Letâ€™s imagine that a group of Computational Chemists are working together to discover potential inhibitors for the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using the same methodology described in the above text. 

These chemists have identified three compounds: Compound A, Compound B and Compound C, which they believe can be used to develop new drugs. They also know that each compound has a different chemical structure. 

The Computational Chemist 1, using computer simulations, predicts that Compound A will bind with the main protease better than Compound B or C. The computational chemist 2, who's working on X-ray crystallography, argues that Compound B is more stable and efficient in blocking the enzyme activity compared to A. Lastly, a Computational Chemist 3 says that Compound C has potential as an inhibitor due to its unique molecular structure, despite not being as effective as A or B according to their respective analyses.

Here are some additional pieces of information:
- If Compound A is more effective than Compound B, then it's also less stable and efficient compared to Compound C. 
- Compound B is not the least effective in inhibiting enzyme activity.
- Only one Chemistâ€™s prediction was accurate.

Question: Who was correct?



Let's start by understanding the information given: 
1) The first statement suggests a transitive property, if A > B and A < C then B > C. But since we don't know the value of 'A' in this context, it can't be concluded that Compound A is less effective than Compound C. This means the first statement doesnâ€™t provide enough information to conclusively prove or disprove the second.
2) The second statement implies that Compound B is more effective than at least one other compound (A or C). 
3) The third statement says Compound C is less effective than A and B, but it's still potential. This indicates that while Compound C isn't as efficient or stable as the others, it does show some effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2. 


By inductive logic and proof by contradiction:
We know only one Chemistâ€™s prediction was accurate and the first statement doesn't provide enough information to confirm any Chemist's prediction. We also know that Compound B is more effective than at least one other compound (A or C) but it isn't clear if this makes Compound B the most effective or not. 
Applying proof by contradiction, assuming none of them are correct contradicts our initial assumption that only one Chemistâ€™s prediction was accurate. Hence, we can conclude that all three chemists were partially right because each has given some information about a compound's potential as an inhibitor to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.

Answer: All three Computational Chemists were partially correct; their predictions provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and stability of Compound A, B and C as inhibitors for the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section16><a href="new_research.html#section16" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "Study Examines COVID Immunity in Animals"</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section17><a href="new_research.html#section17" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– AI: Simple title for easy understanding.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section18><a href="new_research.html#section18" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "Nano-DNA vaccine prevents COVID-19 in females."</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section19><a href="new_research.html#section19" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Post-COVID-19 Mental Health: Anxiety & Mood Disorders.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section20><a href="new_research.html#section20" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– AI</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section21><a href="new_research.html#section21" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "How accurate are COVID-19 tests?

In the conversation between the user and AI, they talked about predicting safe drugs to fight COVID. To do this, they used a process that combines in silico (computer simulation) and in vitro (lab experiments). 

Let's consider four compounds named A, B, C, D. Each one of them is synthesized by the AI algorithm after being predicted based on its in silico properties, but some data was lost during the translation from a scientific report to the computational model.

We know:
1) Compound A has the least number of potential side effects when compared with compounds B and D.
2) In vitro experiments showed that compound B is less effective than A but more effective than C.
3) Compound D in silico was found to be more dangerous than A.
4) The AI algorithm did not provide any data for the efficacy of compound C.

Question: What could be one possible order of compounds from most effective (first place) to least effective (last place), considering both their predicted properties and their effectiveness after in vitro experiments?


To solve this puzzle, we need to use deductive logic, tree-of-thought reasoning, proof by exhaustion, inductive logic, proof by contradiction and direct proof.

Let's start with the compounds A and B. We know that in silico A was less dangerous than D, so it must be more effective as well. The only information we have about B is that it's less effective than A but more effective than C. This means that B is also more effective than D (as C is less effective than B). So far, our order is: A > B > D and B > C

Next, we can use the fact that in vitro experiments were conducted with compounds A and D. We know from step1 that A is the most effective compound. Let's assume for contradiction that D was more effective than A. This contradicts our previous conclusion in Step 1, so this assumption is false. Hence, by proof of exhaustion, we can say that A > B > C > D

Answer: The order of compounds from most effective to least effective is A > B > C > D</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section29><a href="new_research.html#section29" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "Study on Covid-19 Variants and a Vaccine."</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section30><a href="new_research.html#section30" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "Easy way to find drugs for COVID-19: Redox switch"</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section31><a href="new_research.html#section31" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Correlation between IgM N-glycosylation and COVID-19 Severity, Complement Deposition Rate.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section32><a href="new_research.html#section32" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– AI</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section33><a href="new_research.html#section33" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Electrochemical Immunosensor Detects COVID-19 Using Chicken Antibodies.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section34><a href="new_research.html#section34" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Phages show how COVID-19 attaches to cells, making a useful protein model.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section35><a href="new_research.html#section35" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– COVID-19 variant death rates linked to CRP genes.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section36><a href="new_research.html#section36" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "AI: Omicron variants studied in Bangkok from Dec 2022 to Aug 2023."</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section37><a href="new_research.html#section37" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Using adjuvants for better COVID-19 vaccines.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section38><a href="new_research.html#section38" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "Study Looks at SARS-CoV-2 Cases Before Vaccine Rollout"</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section39><a href="new_research.html#section39" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Easy-to-understand AI assistant: Shorten title! #SimpleLanguage #UserFriendly #ViralProtection</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section40><a href="new_research.html#section40" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– Trim28 and SUMOylation Boosts Coronavirus Infection.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section41><a href="new_research.html#section41" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– "Monkeys Get Antibodies From New Vaccine"


Imagine that the AI assistant is a medical scientist, and it has been experimenting with three different vaccines on three groups of rhesus macaques. The vaccines are named A, B, C. 

1. Each vaccine contains a neutralizing antibody elicited upon Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle vaccination.
2. Each group of monkeys was vaccinated with one type of vaccine and there is no cross-over or mixing between the groups.
3. After the experiment, it's found that:
a) The monkeys in Group 1 did not receive vaccine B.
b) The monkeys in Group 2 received vaccine C.
c) Vaccine A was given to a group of monkeys which is either group 1 or 3.

Question: Can you determine the type of each vaccine (A, B and C) that was administered to each group?


Let's start with proof by exhaustion: we will try all possible combinations for each group until we find the one that fits all conditions. 

First, let's place A in Group 1. This means Group 3 has either B or C. But since B cannot be given to Group 1 (condition a), Group 3 must have vaccine C. This gives us:
Group 1: Vaccine A
Group 2: Vaccine C
Group 3: Vaccine C


Now, we know that group 2 received the vaccine C (from condition b). So, it has to be grouped with group 3 who also got a neutralizing antibody elicited upon Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle vaccination (since there is no cross-over or mixing between the groups). Therefore, by direct proof and property of transitivity, we conclude:
Group 1: Vaccine A
Group 2: Group 3: Vaccine C
Answer: Thus, group 1 received vaccine A, group 2 received vaccine B, and group 3 received vaccine C.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id=section42><a href="new_research.html#section42" target="_top">News: ðŸ¤– How does COVID-19 affect time between infections?
