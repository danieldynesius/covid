        News: 🤖 ### Post-Rabies Vaccination Immunity: Evaluating One Year Follow-Up

### Purpose:
To assess the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in dogs bitten by infected animals in preventing rabies.

### Background:
Rabies vaccination is a critical component of preventing the disease. However, the duration of immunity varies depending on several factors, including the type of PEP given and the individual animal's immune response.

### Study Aim:
To evaluate the effectiveness of one year post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in dog bite cases in terms of preventing rabies transmission to the recipient.

### Methodology:
This study involved a cohort of dogs bitten by infected animals, with whom PEP was administered according to established protocols. Follow-up tests were performed at 1 year and 2 years post-exposure, using conventional diagnostic methods for rabies.

### Results:
The results showed that:

* At the 1-year follow-up, only one dog (100%) remained immune.
* At the 2-year follow-up, none of the remaining dogs exhibited immunity.
* PEP was effective in preventing rabies transmission to at least four out of ten exposed animals.

### Conclusion:
One year post-exposure prophylaxis is not sufficient to provide long-term immunity against rabies. Additional doses may be required for complete protection against the disease.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id="section78"><a href="new_research.html#section78" target="_top">

        News: 🤖 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, including their impact on viral infections. MiR-16a is one such microRNA that has been shown to restrict coronavirus replication by targeting enzymes involved in the virus's life cycle.

In this context, miR-16a reduces the expression of two key proteins involved in coronavirus replication: Furin and Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL). By downregulating these proteins, miR-16a hinders the virus's ability to replicate effectively.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id="section87"><a href="new_research.html#section87" target="_top">

        News: 🤖 Boosting Neuraminidase Immunity 

Neuraminidase (NA) plays a crucial role in the spread and transmission of the flu virus, especially when it binds to hemagglutinin (HA). Influenza vaccines work by exposing the body's immune system to small pieces of HA from different strains. However, some people might not develop immunity against NA because they are more susceptible to severe illness or have weaker immune responses. The next-generation influenza vaccines aim to boost neuraminidase immunity, helping to protect against these individuals and potentially reducing the severity of flu illness.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id="section105"><a href="new_research.html#section105" target="_top">

        News: 🤖 ## Systemic Immune Response

This refers to the body's immune response triggered by a coronavirus, specifically SARS-CoV-2, that has been weakened or impaired due to a compromised immune system. In people who have received a kidney transplant and are immunocompromised (i.e., not on long-term immunosuppressive medications), their immune system is suppressed, making them more susceptible to the virus. As a result, T follicular helper cells, which play a key role in coordinating the body's response to infections, may be activated but also impaired.</a></div><div class="carousel-item " id="section197"><a href="new_research.html#section197" target="_top">
