                <p>Efficacy of the tetravalent protein COVID-19 vaccine, SCTV01E: a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Imagine you've got this superhero team-up of COVID-19 vaccines called "SCTV01E," and it's fighting off the latest viral villains â€“ Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 (the newest one). We tested these heroes in a big experiment with 9,223 people to see how well they protect against COVID-19 just seven days after getting their shot! Guess what? Our superhero team was like, "Nice job!" and stopped 23 out of 75 sickness cases. They were even better at stopping sneaky infections two weeks later! Plus, our heroes are so strong that they could face Omicron BA.5 with a whopping booster effect! And don't worry about the side effects â€“ it was mostly just some mild stuff like soreness or tiredness. So, SCTV01E is here to help us keep up with COVID-19 as it changes its moves and tries new tricks!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants emphasizes the need for multivalent vaccines capable of simultaneously targeting multiple strains. SCTV01E is a tetravalent COVID-19 vaccine derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1. In this double-blinded placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy trial (NCT05308576), the primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against COVID-19 seven days post-vaccination in individuals without recent infection. Other endpoints included evaluating safety, immunogenicity, and the VE against all SARS-CoV-2 infections in individuals meeting the study criteria. Between December 26, 2022, and January 15, 2023, 9,223 individuals were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive SCTV01E or a placebo. SCTV01E showed a VE of 69.4% (95% CI: 50.6, 81.0) 7 days post-vaccination, with 75 cases in the placebo group and 23 in the SCTV01E group for the primary endpoint. VEs were 79.7% (95% CI: 51.0, 91.6) and 82.4% (95% CI: 57.9, 92.6), respectively, for preventing symptomatic infection and all SARS-CoV-2 infections 14 days post-vaccination. SCTV01E elicited a 25.0-fold higher neutralizing antibody response against Omicron BA.5 28 days post-vaccination compared to placebo. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient, with no reported vaccine-related SAE, adverse events of special interest (AESI), or deaths. The trial aligned with the shift from dominant variants BA.5 and BF.7 to XBB, suggesting SCTV01E as a potential vaccine alternative effective against present and future variants.</p>

                <p><strong>Title</strong></p>
                <p>Inflammation in the COVID-19 airway is due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, you know that nasty bug called COVID-19? Well, it messes up our airways and makes people super sick by causing them to have way too much inflammation. It's like when your friend accidentally spills soda on the floor and you all try to clean it up - but instead of just a little mess, there's an entire fizzy storm! This happens because something called SARS-CoV-2 is playing with our body's signaling system (think of these signals as tiny messengers) that usually keeps things in check.

Now, this same thing also happens to people with cystic fibrosis - a condition where their bodies have trouble controlling inflammation because they can't do something important called CFTR signaling properly. Researchers think the virus is like a sneaky villain that blocks these signals in both COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis patients, causing even more chaos!

But hey, there's some good news too! Scientists found out that certain medicines, known as cardiac glycosides (imagine them as special cleaning agents), can help block the virus from doing its sneaky stuff. By using these "cleaning agents," they were able to get our body's tiny messengers back on track and stop the inflammation in both COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis patients!

So, in a nutshell, this exciting research tells us that by understanding how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with important signals inside our bodies, we can find ways to help people recover from COVID-19 and related conditions like cystic fibrosis. Super cool, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2-contributes to sickness and death in COVID-19 patients partly by inducing a hyper-proinflammatory immune response in the host airway. This hyper-proinflammatory state involves activation of signaling by NFÎºB, and unexpectedly, ENaC, the epithelial sodium channel. Post-infection inflammation may also contribute to "Long COVID"/PASC. Enhanced signaling by NFÎºB and ENaC also marks the airway of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a life-limiting proinflammatory genetic disease due to inactivating mutations in the CFTR gene. We therefore hypothesized that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway might similarly be due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and therefore activation of both NFÎºB and ENaC signaling. We used western blot and electrophysiological techniques, and an organoid model of normal airway epithelia, differentiated on an airâ€“liquid-interface (ALI). We found that CFTR protein expression and CFTR cAMP-activated chloride channel activity were lost when the model epithelium was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. As hypothesized, the absence of CFTR led to activation of both TNFÎ±/NFÎºB signaling and Î± and Î³ ENaC. We had previously shown that the cardiac glycoside drugs digoxin, digitoxin and ouabain blocked interaction of spike protein and ACE2. Consistently, addition of 30Â nM concentrations of the cardiac glycoside drugs, prevented loss of both CFTR protein and CFTR channel activity. ACE2 and CFTR were found to co-immunoprecipitate in both basal cells and differentiated epithelia. Thus spike-dependent CFTR loss might involve ACE2 as a bridge between Spike and CFTR. In addition, spike exposure to the epithelia resulted in failure of endosomal recycling to return CFTR to the plasma membrane. Thus, failure of CFTR recovery from endosomal recycling might be a mechanism for spike-dependent loss of CFTR. Finally, we found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection induced loss of CFTR protein, which was rescued by the cardiac glycoside drugs digitoxin and ouabain. Based on experiments with this organoid model of small airway epithelia, and comparisons with 16HBE14o- and other cell types expressing normal CFTR, we predict that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway may be mediated by inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus inducing a cystic fibrosis-like clinical phenotype. To our knowledge this is the first time COVID-19 airway inflammation has been experimentally traced in normal subjects to a contribution from SARS-CoV-2 spike-dependent inhibition of CFTR signaling.</p>

                <p>Insights from an N3C RECOVER EHR-based cohort study characterizing SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and Long COVID</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, we're diving deep into this super long list of people who caught the nasty bug called COVID not just once but a couple of times. We checked out their health details and found some cool stuff! Turns out if you got really sick at first, it might hit harder when your body fights it again later on. Plus, more folks seem to have trouble with long-lasting symptoms after the first scare than those who get sniffled up a second time. Isn't science wild? Stay tuned for what we learn next!

### Updated Abstract:
Hey, friends! Imagine COVID as that annoying cold you can't shake offâ€”it sticks around longer some days. We've been peeking into the health records of over 3 million people and discovered something pretty interesting. If someone had a tough time with their first encounter with the virus, they might face another round more fiercely down the line. Also, after that initial battle, many seem to struggle with ongoing issues. It's like COVID just can't let go! As we keep learning, who knows what else this mystery bug will teach us?

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>BackgroundAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for over 3 years, reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood. We aim to characterize reinfection, understand development of Long COVID after reinfection, and compare severity of reinfection with initial infection.MethodsWe use an electronic health record study cohort of over 3 million patients from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative. We calculate summary statistics, effect sizes, and Kaplanâ€“Meier curves to better understand COVID-19 reinfections.ResultsHere we validate previous findings of reinfection incidence (6.9%), the occurrence of most reinfections during the Omicron epoch, and evidence of multiple reinfections. We present findings that the proportion of Long COVID diagnoses is higher following initial infection than reinfection for infections in the same epoch. We report lower albumin levels leading up to reinfection and a statistically significant association of severity between initial infection and reinfection (chi-squared value: 25,697,p-value: <0.0001) with a medium effect size (Cramerâ€™sV: 0.20, DoFâ€‰=â€‰3). Individuals who experienced severe initial and first reinfection were older in age and at a higher mortality risk than those who had mild initial infection and reinfection.ConclusionsIn a large patient cohort, we find that the severity of reinfection appears to be associated with the severity of initial infection and that Long COVID diagnoses appear to occur more often following initial infection than reinfection in the same epoch. Future research may build on these findings to better understand COVID-19 reinfections.</p>

                <p>Selection and characterization of human scFvs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein isolated from antibody libraries of COVID-19 patients</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>In 2019, when COVID-1ayer took over with its mysterious pneumonia, scientists were super curious about how it worked inside our bodies. They first looked at one part of the virus called "spike protein," but then realized another piece, named "nucleocapsid," was really important too! This little guy helps the virus copy itself and hide from our body's defenses, while also being super recognizable to our immune system. So they decided to make a huge collection of tiny pieces (called scFvs) by using blood samples from folks who had COVID-1ayer. They put these bits together in different ways - some stayed inside cells and others were grown outside like plants. Some really stuck well, either staying as little cell buddies or growing strong on their own. This cool collection could help us learn more about the virus and maybe even spot it faster!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>In 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in China, causing the pneumonia named COVID-19. At the beginning, all research efforts were focused on the spike (S) glycoprotein. However, it became evident that the nucleocapsid (N) protein is pivotal in viral replication, genome packaging and evasion of the immune system, is highly immunogenic, which makes it another compelling target for antibody development alongside the spike protein. This study focused on the construction of single chain fragments variable (scFvs) libraries from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients to establish a valuable, immortalized and extensive antibodies source. We used the Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology to select a panel of scFvs against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The whole panel of scFv was expressed and characterized both as intrabodies and recombinant proteins. ScFvs were then divided into 2 subgroups: those that exhibited high binding activity to N protein when expressed in yeast or in mammalian cells as intrabodies, and those purified as recombinant proteins, displaying affinity for recombinant N protein in the nanomolar range. This panel of scFvs against the N protein represents a novel platform for research and potential diagnostic applications.</p>

                <p>A particular epidemiological profile: disparities in access to contraceptive methods in Brazil during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>During the scary times of COVID-19 at the University of Campinas in Brazil, we checked out how many people were having trouble getting their birth control right. We asked over a thousand students, mostly ladies aged 20 to 39, about who they are and if they've ever needed new ways to prevent pregnancy during this crazy pandemic time. It turns out that nearly one in four changed what they were using for protection because of the virus. And almost twenty percent wanted to try something different too but ran into problems like not being able to see a doctor easily enough. This tells us young Black and mixed-race folks with less money, education, and jobs might be having an even harder time handling health stuff during this tough period.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Our objective was to study disparities in access to contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a cross-sectional study at the University of Campinas, Brazil using a Google questionnaire applied from December 2021 until February 2022, disseminated via snowball technique. The survey asked about sociodemographic characteristics and contraceptive use, as well as the demand for new methods and difficulties in continuing to use contraceptives during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed 1018 completed questionnaires; in total, 742 (72.9%) were women aged between 20 and 39Â years, 746 (73.3%) were White and 602 (59.2%) used contraceptives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, about 23% of respondents changed their method and approximately 20% of respondents looked for new methods. Among the latter, 31.3% reported some difficulty with obtaining guidance on new methods while only 5.3% of the respondents reported some difficulty with continuing their contraceptive. The main difficulty in both cases was the difficulty with getting a healthcare provider appointment. Our results point to a particular epidemiological population, of younger black and biracial women, with lower education and lower income, which suffered health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic and found difficulties with using contraceptives and accessing family planning services.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Did you know COVID-1st virus can make people feel super sick? Our cool study looked at 117 folks with this bug and checked out how their bodies fought back by releasing proteins called antigens and viral RNA. We found that when the level of these proteins was really high in some patients, especially those who didn't make it, they might need more help from doctors right away! This study is like a detective story for scientists trying to understand COVID-19 better - so stay tuned as we learn more each day!

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild upper to severe lower respiratory tract infections.However, the dynamics of nucleocapsid (N) protein antigenemia and RNAemia are not fully understood. We conducted a cohort study involving 117 patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, focusing on the kinetics of antigenemia and RNAemia and their association with various clinical characteristics. The patients had a median age of 66.0Â years (52.0â€“79.0Â years), with a gender distribution of 46.2% male and 53.8% female. Antigenemia reached 100% in fatal cases during the first week after admission. The sensitivity/specificity of antigenemia for diagnosis were 64.7%/73.0% at admission, 69.1%/100% in Week 1, and 66.3%/100% in Week 2. Additionally, the rates of antigenemia in asymptomatic patients were 27.3% upon admission and 22.0% in Week 1, respectively; however, no antigenemia was in samples collected in Week 2. Viral RNAemia was not detected in asymptomatic patients, but RNAemia viral loads were elevated in fatal cases. Kaplanâ€“Meier survival curves demonstrated a higher mortality rate when antigenemia concentrations were elevated in the follow-up samples (P=â€‰0.005). Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of viral N-protein antigenemia and RNAemia according to disease severity and clinical classification. Our findings suggest that highest concentrations of antigenemia in fatal cases occur in the first week after admission, indicating that early elevated antigenemia may serve as a marker of mortality risk.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Imagine if you were given a superhero power after battling the bad guy who caused worldwide health chaos, that's kind of what happens when our bodies fight off COVID-19! This invisible battle leaves us with special defenders in our blood called antibodies. They keep an eye out for sneaky parts (proteins) from the virus to stop it from causing trouble again. Our study looked at these superheroes' abilities over time, and guess what? Some of them like the 'nucleocapsid' hero were really good at sticking around even after many months! Others, particularly the 'spike' defenders, kept getting stronger each month they stayed in action. This is pretty cool because it shows our bodies remember how to fight off COVID-19 and keep us safer for a long time!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that gave rise to COVID-19 infection produced a worldwide health crisis. The virus can cause a serious or even fatal disease. Comprehending the complex immunological responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for identifying pivotal elements that shape the course of the disease and its enduring effects on immunity. The span and potency of antibody responses provide valuable perspicuity into the resilience of post-infection immunity. The analysis of existing literature reveals a diverse controversy, confining varying data about the persistence of particular antibodies as well as the multifaceted factors that impact their development and titer, Within this study we aimed to understand the dynamics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against nucleocapsid (anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N)) and spike (anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N)) proteins in long-term immunity in convalescent patients, as well as the factors influencing the production and kinetics of those antibodies. We collected 6115 serum samples from 1611 convalescent patients at different post-infection intervals up to 21Â months Study showed that in the fourth month, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N) exhibited their peak mean value, demonstrating a 79% increase compared to the initial month. Over the subsequent eight months, the peak value experienced a modest decline, maintaining a relatively elevated level by the end of study. Conversely, anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) exhibited a consistent increase at each three-month interval over the 15-month period, culminating in a statistically significant peak mean value at the studyâ€™s conclusion. Our findings demonstrate evidence of sustained seropositivity rates for both anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N) and (S), as well as distinct dynamics in the long-term antibody responses, with anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N) levels displaying remarkable persistence and anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) antibodies exhibiting a progressive incline.</p>

                <p>Imagine you've had a super nasty cold called COVID-1 Cookies! Even after getting better, some people still feel like they caught the cookie bug for months or even years later. Our big study looked at over 135,000 folks who got this virus and compared them to more than five million healthy cookies without it. We followed these groups for three years. For most of the cookie-bug survivors, the risk of not being able to do everyday stuff didn't really change after a year. But by the third year, they still lost some chance at living longer and doing fun thingsâ€”kind of like 9 out of 1,000 people in our study had fewer cookies left over. For those who got very sick with it initially, there was less bad news each year, but their cookie jar wasn't as full by the third year either. So while getting better is great, we still need to keep an eye on these folks for a bit longer!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (PASC) in many organ systems. Risks of these sequelae have been characterized up to 2â€‰years after infection, but longer-term follow-up is limited. Here we built a cohort of 135,161 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 5,206,835 controls from the US Department of Veterans Affairs who were followed for 3â€‰years to estimate risks of death and PASC. Among non-hospitalized individuals, the increased risk of death was no longer present after the first year of infection, and risk of incident PASC declined over the 3â€‰years but still contributed 9.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4â€“18.7) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1,000 persons in the third year. Among hospitalized individuals, risk of death declined but remained significantly elevated in the third year after infection (incidence rate ratio: 1.29 (95% CI: 1.19â€“1.40)). Risk of incident PASC declined over the 3â€‰years, but substantial residual risk remained in the third year, leading to 90.0 (95% CI: 55.2â€“124.8) DALYs per 1,000 persons. Altogether, our findings show reduction of risks over time, but the burden of mortality and health loss remains in the third year among hospitalized individuals.</p>

                <p>Initial COVID-19 severity influenced by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells imprints T-cell memory and inversely affects reinfection</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey folks! Our team took a deep dive into how people's immune systems react differently when they catch COVID-19, depending on the seriousness of their symptoms at first. We looked closely at 165 patients and found out that if someone fights off the virus early with strong T cells (think of them as your bodyâ€™s superheroes), they tend to get better quicker and leave the hospital faster! But, if it takes longer for those superheroes to show up or aren't strong enough, folks might have a harder time. Interestingly, we also discovered that how quickly our bodies make antibodies (our immune systemâ€™s way of remembering bad guys) instead of just the amount can affect how severe COVID-19 gets. Plus, those who had really tough times with the virus may actually be less likely to get it again later on â€“ kinda like having an extra shield! This info could help doctors better understand and tackle future waves of this sneaky bug.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The immunoprotective components control COVID-19 disease severity, as well as long-term adaptive immunity maintenance and subsequent reinfection risk discrepancies across initial COVID-19 severity, remain unclarified. Here, we longitudinally analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific immune effectors during the acute infection and convalescent phases of 165 patients with COVID-19 categorized by severity. We found that early and robust SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cell responses ameliorate disease progression and shortened hospital stay, while delayed and attenuated virus-specific CD8+T cell responses are prominent severe COVID-19 features. Delayed antiviral antibody generation rather than titer level associates with severe outcomes. Conversely, initial COVID-19 severity imprints the long-term maintenance of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity, demonstrating that severe convalescents exhibited more sustained virus-specific antibodies and memory T cell responses compared to mild/moderate counterparts. Moreover, initial COVID-19 severity inversely correlates with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk. Overall, our study unravels the complicated interaction between temporal characteristics of virus-specific T cell responses and COVID-19 severity to guide future SARS-CoV-2 wave management.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Did you know that after beating the bug called SARS-CoV-2 (that's what everyone calls Covid), some folks might have a hard time with their breathing? A big study from Korea and Japan found out that 1 in 6 people who had Covid end up having more trouble with it later on. The risk goes up the longer they were sick, but getting vaccinated can help! Even after six months, some people still have issues. So let's stay safe and keep our shields (vaccines) up to protect our breathing, shall we?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Considering the significant burden of post-acute COVID-19 conditions among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we aimed to identify the risk of acute respiratory complications or post-acute respiratory sequelae. A binational population-based cohort study was conducted to analyze the risk of acute respiratory complications or post-acute respiratory sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used a Korean nationwide claim-based cohort (K-COV-N;n=â€‰2,312,748; main cohort) and a Japanese claim-based cohort (JMDC;n=â€‰3,115,606; replication cohort) after multi-to-one propensity score matching. Among 2,312,748 Korean participants (mean age, 47.2â€‰years [SD, 15.6]; 1,109,708 [48.0%] female), 17.1% (394,598/2,312,748) were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The risk of acute respiratory complications or post-acute respiratory sequelae is significantly increased in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population (acute respiratory complications: HR, 8.06 [95% CI, 6.92-9.38]; post-acute respiratory sequelae: 1.68 [1.62-1.75]), and the risk increased with increasing COVID-19 severity. We identified COVID-19 vaccination as an attenuating factor, showing a protective association against acute or post-acute respiratory conditions. Furthermore, while the excess post-acute risk diminished with time following SARS-CoV-2 infection, it persisted beyond 6â€‰months post-infection. The replication cohort showed a similar pattern in the association. Our study comprehensively evaluates respiratory complications in post-COVID-19 conditions, considering attenuating factors such as vaccination status, post-infection duration, COVID-19 severity, and specific respiratory conditions.</p>

                <p>Post-COVID conditions following COVID-19 vaccination: a retrospective matched cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, we're looking at how getting that COVID shot helps keep people from getting seriously sick or passing away if they catch the virus. But what about those pesky health issues folks face even after beating it? We checked out data from big hospitals in the US to see if being vaccinated before catching COVID makes a difference for these long-term health troubles, which come up 30 days to six months later.

We compared people who got their shots with those who didn't and looked at how likely they were to get new problems like skin issues or heart troubles after being sick with the virus. Turns out that vaccinated folks generally had a lower chance of these health hiccups, except for mental health stuff which was about even.

Even cooler? Vaccines seemed to help reduce chances across various categories, like sensory issues and blood-related problemsâ€”regardless if someone caught one of the new COVID strains or how many shots they got before getting sick. So, vaccinations might just be a big thumbs up for keeping long-term health on track after beating the virus!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 vaccinations protect against severe illness and death, but associations with post-COVID conditions (PCC) are less clear. We aimed to evaluate the association between prior COVID-19 vaccination and new-onset PCC among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection across eight large healthcare systems in the United States. This retrospective matched cohort study used electronic health records (EHR) from patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive tests during March 2021-February 2022. Vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 cases were matched on location, test date, severity of acute infection, age, and sex. Vaccination status was ascertained using EHR and integrated data on externally administered vaccines. Adjusted relative risks (RRs) were obtained from Poisson regression. PCC was defined as a new diagnosis in one of 13 PCC categories 30 days to 6 months following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The study included 161,531 vaccinated COVID-19 cases and 161,531 matched unvaccinated cases. Compared to unvaccinated cases, vaccinated cases had a similar or lower risk of all PCC categories except mental health disorders (RR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02â€“1.10). Vaccination was associated with â‰¥10% lower risk of sensory (RR: 0.90, 0.86â€“0.95), circulatory (RR: 0.88, 0.83â€“0.94), blood and hematologic (RR: 0.79, 0.71â€“0.89), skin and subcutaneous (RR: 0.69, 0.66â€“0.72), and non-specific COVID-19 related disorders (RR: 0.53, 0.51â€“0.56). In general, associations were stronger at younger ages but mostly persisted regardless of SARS-CoV-2 variant period, receipt of â‰¥3 vs. 1â€“2 vaccine doses, or time since vaccination. Pre-infection vaccination was associated with reduced risk of several PCC outcomes and hence may decrease the long-term consequences of COVID-19.</p>

                <p>Dynamic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genetic mutations in a lung transplantation patient with persistent COVID-19</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Ever heard about super tiny, invisible germs called COVID? Since they've been around, these sneaky critters have changed their outfits multiple times! One of them is named Omicron BA.5 and can be tough to tackle, especially for folks who are already having a hard time with health issues like lung problems from an operation. Scientists found that this germ got super resistant when given a medicine called Remdesivir (RDV). This made it even harder for the body's defenses to beat them back. But hey, don't worry! Researchers are on it, trying to understand these changes and help keep everyone safe and healthy. So stay tuned for more updates from our medical heroes!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variant strains with altered characteristics have emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir (RDV), a ribonucleotide analogue inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase, has become a valuable therapeutic agent. However, immunosuppressed hosts may respond inadequately to RDV and develop chronic persistent infections. A patient with respiratory failure caused by interstitial pneumonia, who had undergone transplantation of the left lung, developed COVID-19 caused by Omicron BA.5 strain with persistent chronic viral shedding, showing viral fusogenicity. Genome-wide sequencing analyses revealed the occurrence of several viral mutations after RDV treatment, followed by dynamic changes in the viral populations. The C799F mutation in nsp12 was found to play a pivotal role in conferring RDV resistance, preventing RDV-triphosphate from entering the active site of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The occurrence of diverse mutations is a characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, which mutates frequently. Herein, we describe the clinical case of an immunosuppressed host in whom inadequate treatment resulted in highly diverse SARS-CoV-2 mutations that threatened the patientâ€™s health due to the development of drug-resistant variants.</p>

                <p>SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity after bivalent BA.4/5 COVID-19-vaccination in previously infected and non-infected individuals</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Did you know getting a COVID shot can give your body superpowers against the virus? But here's the scoop: some folks who had the first wave (SARS-CoV-2) already got it, and when they get their booster with new mRNA vaccines for BA.4/5 - those are like upgraded versions of previous ones - things look different!

Our study found that people without a past infection have even more powerful shields (anti-spike IgG antibodies) and superheroes (neutralizing titers) after their booster. But guess what? Those who've been through the first wave also get stronger, but not as much.

Both groups are ready to take down any version of Omicron we throw at them - itâ€™s like they have a big shield against all things COVID! Even though they fight together when it comes to fighting off those nasty variants, only some without the past infection got sick again after their booster.

In short, if you've been through COVID before and get your new booster shot, don't worry - you still have a strong line of defense! But everyone can use this info to make sure theyâ€™re extra protected against any sneaky COVID waves that may come our way. Catch ya later!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Knowledge is limited as to how prior SARS-CoV-2 infection influences cellular and humoral immunity after booster-vaccination with bivalent BA.4/5-adapted mRNA-vaccines, and whether vaccine-induced immunity may indicate subsequent infection. In this observational study, individuals with prior infection (n=â€‰64) showed higher vaccine-induced anti-spike IgG-antibodies and neutralizing titers, but the relative increase was significantly higher in non-infected individuals (n=â€‰63). In general, both groups showed higher neutralizing activity towards the parental strain than towards Omicron-subvariants BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5. In contrast, CD4 or CD8 T cell levels towards spike from the parental strain and the Omicron-subvariants, and cytokine expression profiles were similar irrespective of prior infection. Breakthrough infections occurred more frequently among previously non-infected individuals, who had significantly lower vaccine-induced spike-specific neutralizing activity and CD4 T cell levels. In summary, we show that immunogenicity after BA.4/5-bivalent vaccination differs between individuals with and without prior infection. Moreover, our results may help to improve prediction of breakthrough infections.</p>

                <p>Neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acid protein levels are elevated in post-mild COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Imagine it's like the COVID-1rania aftermath for our brains! We checked out 147 folks who caught a mild or no symptom from that pesky virus and had their brain proteins (think of them as tiny superheroes) measured. These heroes, called sNfL and sGFAP, are like clues telling us about any damage to our nerves and special cells in the brain. We compared these guys with a group of 82 people who were COVID-free. Turns out, those who've been through the virus have higher levels of these proteins right after they recover - not so great for their memory game (a fancy test called CFQ). But guess what? After ten months, things got better but weren't quite back to normal. So, our brains are like a battlefield that slowly heals over time!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Given the huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears of paramount importance to assess the cognitive effects on the population returning to work after COVID-19 resolution. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) represent promising biomarkers of neuro-axonal damage and astrocytic activation. In this cohort study, we explored the association between sNfL and sGFAP concentrations and cognitive performance in a group of 147 adult workers with a previous asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19, one week and, in 49 of them, ten months after SARS-Cov2 negativization and compared them to a group of 82 age and BMI-matched healthy controls (HCs). sNfL and sGFAP concentrations were assessed using SimoaTM assay Neurology 2-Plex B Kit. COVID-19 patients were interviewed one-on-one by trained physicians and had to complete a list of questionnaires, including the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ). At the first assessment (T0), sNfL and sGFAP levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in HCs (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for both). The eleven COVID-19 patients with cognitive impairment had significantly higher levels of sNfL and sGFAP than the others (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005 for both). At the subsequent follow-up (T1), sNfL and sGFAP levels showed a significant decrease (median sNfL 18.3Â pg/mL; median sGFAP 77.2Â pg/mL), although they were still higher than HCs (median sNfL 7.2Â pg/mL, median sGFAP 63.5Â pg/mL). Our results suggest an ongoing damage involving neurons and astrocytes after SARS-Cov2 negativization, which reduce after ten months even if still evident compared to HCs.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Did you know that when folks with COVID-19 cough or breathe out tiny droplets into the air, they might be spreading the virus? Our team used some cool tech to catch these droplets and found that a bunch of them can still carry the bug. This is especially true for about half of those who tested positive for COVID-19 even up to 9 days after feeling sick. It turns out, people with fewer defenses against this virus (like antibodies) might be more likely to spread it in tiny droplets too. We also found a way to tell if someone is super contagious using something as simple as their nose swab test results and a blood test. This helps us figure out how to stop the bug from jumping from one person to another, like by making sure places are well-ventilated!


Instruction 2 (More Difficult with Additional Constraints):
</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol remains contentious. Importantly, whether cough or breath-generated bioaerosols can harbor viable and replicating virus remains largely unclarified. We performed size-fractionated aerosol sampling (Andersen cascade impactor) and evaluated viral culturability in human cell lines (infectiousness), viral genetics, and host immunity in ambulatory participants with COVID-19. Sixty-one percent (27/44) and 50% (22/44) of participants emitted variant-specific culture-positive aerosols <10Î¼m and <5Î¼m, respectively, for up to 9 days after symptom onset. Aerosol culturability is significantly associated with lower neutralizing antibody titers, and suppression of transcriptomic pathways related to innate immunity and the humoral response. A nasopharyngeal Ct <17 rules-in ~40% of aerosol culture-positives and identifies those who are probably highly infectious. A parsimonious three transcript blood-based biosignature is highly predictive of infectious aerosol generation (PPVâ€‰>â€‰95%). There is considerable heterogeneity in potential infectiousness i.e., only 29% of participants were probably highly infectious (produced culture-positive aerosols <5Î¼m at ~6 days after symptom onset). These data, which comprehensively confirm variant-specific culturable SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol, inform the targeting of transmission-related interventions and public health containment strategies emphasizing improved ventilation.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there, did you know some people still wonder if getting sick with that super annoying virus (we're talking COVID) could mess up your health for a long time? Well, our team took on this challenge by checking out the records of over 1 million folks who caught that bug in Hong Kong. We also looked at how they were doing after vaccines and compared them to people who didnâ€™t catch it or weren't vaccinated yet. Guess what? Those fully decked-out with COVID shots seemed to have a better shot against health troubles, like heart problems or even passing away, especially if they got an extra jab after being sick for up to a year! So yeah, the more you get your shots when you can (and not getting too close when you're ill), it looks like there are fewer worries down the line. Pretty cool stuff, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The persisting risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the protection against such risk conferred by COVID-19 vaccination remains unclear. Here we conducted a retrospective territory-wide cohort study on 1,175,277 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by their vaccination status and non-infected controls to evaluate the risk of clinical sequelae, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using a territory-wide public healthcare database with population-based vaccination records in Hong Kong. A progressive reduction in risk of all-cause mortality was observed over one year between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and controls. Patients with complete vaccination or have received booster dose incurred a lower risk of health consequences including major cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality than unvaccinated or patients with incomplete vaccination 30-90 days after infection. Completely vaccinated and patients with booster dose of vaccines did not incur significant higher risk of health consequences from 271 and 91 days of infection onwards, respectively, whilst un-vaccinated and incompletely vaccinated patients continued to incur a greater risk of clinical sequelae for up to a year following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provided real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its persistence following infection.</p>

                <p>SARS-CoV-2 infection status in corneal preservation solution and COVID-19 prevalence after corneal transplantation</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Imagine you've just received a new contact lens - but instead of being from a store, it comes from an eye that needed help during the COVID times! A group of smart scientists checked every single one to make sure they didn't carry any sneaky COVID germs. They looked into 143 sets of eyes (that's like checking over 2860 new lenses) and found all were clear - no COVID-related trouble!

The doctors also kept a watch on the folks who got their new "lenses" to ensure they didn't catch any bugs. Although everyone took extra medicine, none of them ended up with COVID. So if we test every donor eye first and it comes back clean, getting these special lenses is pretty safe!

But since taking this extra-strong bug protection can make folks more likely to get sick from other things later on (yikes), doctors still check all the eyes for COVID just in case. It's like doing a thorough background check before giving someone your phone number - better safe than sorry, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The potential risks associated with organs from COVID-19-infected donors were unclear. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection status of corneas transplanted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the corneal preservation solution that was used for corneal transplantation. We also examined the postoperative health status of the recipients. This study included 144 transplants in 143 eyes. Ninety-nine eyes of imported corneas and 10 of the 14 corneas donated in the prefecture were PCR tested at our hospital, and all were SARS-CoV-2 negative. All corneal transplants were performed after confirming their SARS-CoV-2 negativity by a PCR using a corneal preservation solution at our hospital or a nasopharyngeal swab at a previous facility. Despite postoperative steroid administration, no patient developed COVID-19 infection until discharge. Hence, if the donor's nasopharyngeal swab test is SARS-CoV-2 negative, COVID-19 infection in the recipient due to corneal transplantation may be prevented. Since corneal transplant recipients are susceptible to infection due to prolonged steroid administration and are at high risk for severe diseases if infection occurs, SARS-CoV-2 detection testing using nasopharyngeal swabs in donors should be performed.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Imagine you caught the COVID bug and now want to fight off any lingering effects after getting your shot. Scientists looked at 540 people, some who still felt sick (PCC) and some not, all of whom got their superhero shots. They found that those with PCC had fewer signs of inflammation in their blood after taking two or more shots compared to unvaccinated folks, especially if they were dealing with tummy troubles. So for a few who still have stomach issues, getting vaccinated again might help them feel better!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The rapid development of safe and effective vaccines helped to prevent severe disease courses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and to mitigate the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is evidence that vaccination may reduce the risk of developing post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC), this effect may depend on the viral variant. Therapeutic effects of post-infection vaccination have been discussed but the data for individuals with PCC remains inconclusive. In addition, extremely rare side effects after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may resemble the heterogeneous PCC phenotype. Here, we analyze the plasma levels of 25 cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 directed antibodies in 540 individuals with or without PCC relative to one or two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations as well as in 20 uninfected individuals one month after their initial mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. While none of the SARS-CoV-2 naÃ¯ve individuals reported any persisting sequelae or exhibited PCC-like dysregulation of plasma cytokines, we detected lower levels of IL-1Î² and IL-18 in patients with ongoing PCC who received one or two vaccinations at a median of six months after infection as compared to unvaccinated PCC patients. This reduction correlated with less frequent reporting of persisting gastrointestinal symptoms. These data suggest that post-infection vaccination in patients with PCC might be beneficial in a subgroup of individuals displaying gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Imagine a new superhero team called "Post-COVID Squad" where 590 people shared their experiences after overcoming the COVID-19 villain. Just like in comic books, some heroes faced different challenges: some had trouble breathing or moving (minimal deficits), while others had brain fog or memory issues (mental/cognitive ones). But wait, there's a twist! Some heroes were females and battled unique obstacles due to their gender. Our superhero team also found that the heavier COVID-19 virus burden in their bodies and lower-than-expected immune responses affected some differently during recovery. Scientists are working hard to find clues by studying our heroes' blood cells, hoping to help everyone recover stronger after this tough battle!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a significant public health concern. We describe Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) on 590 participants prospectively assessed from hospital admission for COVID-19 through one year after discharge. Modeling identified 4 PRO clusters based on reported deficits (minimal, physical, mental/cognitive, and multidomain), supporting heterogenous clinical presentations in PASC, with sub-phenotypes associated with female sex and distinctive comorbidities. During the acute phase of disease, a higher respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral burden and lower Receptor Binding Domain and Spike antibody titers were associated with both the physical predominant and the multidomain deficit clusters. A lower frequency of circulating B lymphocytes by mass cytometry (CyTOF) was observed in the multidomain deficit cluster. Circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) was significantly elevated in the mental/cognitive predominant and the multidomain clusters. Future efforts to link PASC to acute anti-viral host responses may help to better target treatment and prevention of PASC.</p>

                <p>Predictors of the post-COVID condition following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Ever wondered what happens after someone gets over COVID? Our super cool study from Norway dove into this mystery. We checked out health records for a bunch (like 214,000!) people who caught the virus and saw if they had any issues way down the line â€“ at least three months later.

Turns out folks with some health bumps before COVID are more likely to have problems afterward. We spotted this in those dealing with breathing trouble or mental fog, for instance. But don't worry! Our smart computer brains also tried guessing if someone might face these troubles later by looking at their past health and what kind of COVID bug they caught - even considering whether they got a vaccine jab. And guess what? We were onto something â€“ our system was pretty good, like 79% accurate in predicting future woes!

So now we've uncovered clues about who might have to deal with lingering COVID troubles and how to maybe spot them before they start. Cool, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Whereas the nature of the post-COVID condition following mild acute COVID-19 is increasingly well described in the literature, knowledge of its risk factors, and whether it can be predicted, remains limited. This study, conducted in Norway, uses individual-level register data from 214,667 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals covering a range of demographic, socioeconomic factors, as well as cause-specific healthcare utilization in the years prior to infection to assess the risk of post-COVID complaints â‰¥3 months after testing positive. We find that the risk of post-COVID was higher among individuals who prior to infection had been diagnosed with psychological (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.12, 95% CI 1.84â€“2.44), respiratory (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.03, 95% CI 1.78â€“2.32), or general and unspecified health problems (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.78, 95% CI 1.52â€“2.09). To assess the predictability of post-COVID after mild initial disease, we use machine learning methods and find that pre-infection characteristics, combined with information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus type and vaccine status, to a considerable extent (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.79, 95% CI 0.75â€“0.81) could predict the occurrence of post-COVID complaints in our sample.</p>

                <p>Original SARS-CoV-2 monovalent and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines: phase 2/3 trial interim results</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there, future world changers! We've got this super cool study where a bunch of adults who had their COVID shots already took an extra one â€“ kinda like leveling up in a video game but for real life protection against the newest Omicron BA.4/BA.5 version. They compared two special boosters: the usual shot (mRNA-1273) and this brand-new combo called mRNA-1273.222, which is like getting a secret power-up! The goal was to see if the new shot could fight off the latest Omicron bad guy just as well or even better than the original one, without causing any trouble. Turns out, this combo might be your best bet in the battle against COVID, especially for those who haven't had it before! Stay tuned because scientists are keeping an eye on how these boosters work with other sneaky variants that could show up later.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>This ongoing, open-label, phase 2/3 trial compared the safety and immunogenicity of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing bivalent mRNA-1273.222 vaccine with the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 mRNA-1273 as booster doses. Two groups of adults who previously received mRNA-1273 as primary vaccination series and booster doses were enrolled in a sequential, nonrandomized manner and received single-second boosters of mRNA-1273 (n=â€‰376) or bivalent mRNA-1273.222 (n=â€‰511). Primary objectives were safety and the noninferiority or superiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and ancestral SARS-CoV-2 with the D614G mutation (ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G)), 28â€‰days post boost. Superiority and noninferiority were based on prespecified success criteria (lower bounds of 95% CIâ€‰>â€‰1 and <â€‰0.677, respectively) of the mRNA-1273.222:mRNA-1273 geometric mean ratios. Bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5-containing mRNA-1273.222 elicited superior nAb responses against BA.4/BA.5 versus mRNA-1273 and noninferior responses against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) at day 29 post boost in participants without detectable prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Day 29 seroresponses against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 were higher for mRNA-1273.222 than for mRNA-1273 and similar against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G), both meeting noninferiority criterion. The safety profile of mRNA-1273.222 was similar to that previously reported for mRNA-1273 with no new safety concerns identified. Continued monitoring of neutralization and real-world vaccine effectiveness are needed as additional divergent-virus variants emerge. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04927065.</p>

            ðŸ¤– COVID Woes Linger? Check Your Immune Powers!"

Now, let's break down why this title is suitable:

1. Easy to understand for young people - The phrase "Check Your Immune Powers!" appeals directly to their curiosity and encourages them to think about their own health in a relatable way. It hints at the importance of immunity without getting too technical.
2. Fun tone - Using alliteration ("Woes Linger?") adds an element of fun, while "Immune Powers" brings a sense of adventure and heroism to the concept of one's own defense system against COVID-1 Written by John Doe
Text: As we continue our efforts in combating the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, it has become increasingly important to understand not only how immunity develops but also what factors may influence its longevity and effectiveness. Recent research suggests that some individuals experience persistent symptoms even after their acute phase of COVID-19 has subsided, raising concerns about long-term health impacts and potential implications for vaccine development strategies. This article delves into the complexities surrounding the relationship between post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection manifestations and immune system function, with a focus on antibody persistence, T cell responses, and their relevance to public health.

Here's the title to update: Persistent symptoms after COVID-19 are not associated with differential SARS-CoV-2 antibody or T cell immunity</a>

                <p>Persistent symptoms after COVID-19 are not associated with differential SARS-CoV-2 antibody or T cell immunity</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Let's talk about a sneaky virus, SARS-CoV-2, and how it sometimes keeps people feeling sick for weeks after they recover from its first wave of attack. Scientists are trying to figure out why some folks keep feeling unwell long after getting better. They looked at the body's defense team - our immune system - in 86 healthcare heroes who caught the virus but didn't get very sick. Even a year later, when they got their vaccine shots to help protect themselves again, those with lingering symptoms had similar defenses against the virus as those without any long-lasting issues. This tells us that how our body fights off this sneaky invader in its first round isn't likely the reason some people feel sick for a longer time.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Among the unknowns in decoding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 persistent symptoms in Long Covid is whether there is a contributory role of abnormal immunity during acute infection. It has been proposed that Long Covid is a consequence of either an excessive or inadequate initial immune response. Here, we analyze SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immunity in 86 healthcare workers with laboratory confirmed mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave. Symptom questionnaires allow stratification into those with persistent symptoms and those without for comparison. During the period up to 18-weeks post-infection, we observe no difference in antibody responses to spike RBD or nucleoprotein, virus neutralization, or T cell responses. Also, there is no difference in the profile of antibody waning. Analysis at 1-year, after two vaccine doses, comparing those with persistent symptoms to those without, again shows similar SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Thus, quantitative differences in these measured parameters of SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity following mild or asymptomatic acute infection are unlikely to have contributed to Long Covid causality.

                <p>Long-term neurological outcome after COVID-19 using all SARS-CoV-2 test results and hospitalisations in Denmark with 22-month follow-up</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So you know how getting sick can sometimes make your brain act funny? Well, this study looked at people who were super sick with COVID-19 (that's the virus we heard so much about) and compared them to folks who had other serious infections. They found out that after being really ill from COVID-19 or even just having a mild case, some people might face more brain troubles than before. But guess what? This doesn't happen as often as with the other sicknesses we're all fighting off. Pretty interesting stuff!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hospitalisation with COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of neurological sequelae; however, representative nationwide studies comparing to other infections with similar severity and also including milder SARS-CoV-2 infections have been lacking. Using the nationwide Danish registers including all SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and hospitalisations between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, we estimate the risk of any first neurological disorder diagnosed in inpatient, outpatient, or emergency room settings. We show that positive tests increase the rate of neurological disorders by a hazard ratio of 1.96 (95% confidence interval: 1.88â€“2.05) compared to individuals not tested and by a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.16) compared to individuals with negative tests only. However, there is no evidence that the risk of neurological disorders is higher for individuals who test positive compared to non-COVID-19 infections treated with anti-infective medication. The risk of neurological disorders is increased after COVID-19-hospitalisation compared to no COVID-19Â hospital admission; however, these risks are comparable to hospitalisation with other respiratory infections (Pvalue 0.328). In conclusion, COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of neurological disorders, but no more than that observed after other infections of similar severity.</p>

                <p>Hey there! We took a look at what happens when people who need extra help for their immune system get two shots to protect against the super sneaky new virus, SARS-CoV-2. Out of 2,686 folks, some didn't make enough shield proteins in their bodies - that's like missing a piece of armor! Those with certain health conditions had a tougher time getting these shields up too. But guess what? Some people still managed to fight off the virus using another type of immune superhero called T cells, even though it was harder for them compared to others who are perfectly healthy or have just one condition. Plus, we found out that this new variant Omicron might be a bit sneakier at hiding from our first line of defense, but the second wave of T cell heroes still came through!

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immune responses and infection outcomes were evaluated in 2,686 patients with varying immune-suppressive disease states after administration of two Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. Overall, 255 of 2,204 (12%) patients failed to develop anti-spike antibodies, with an additional 600 of 2,204 (27%) patients generating low levels (<380â€‰AUâ€‰mlâˆ’1). Vaccine failure rates were highest in ANCA-associated vasculitis on rituximab (21/29, 72%), hemodialysis on immunosuppressive therapy (6/30, 20%) and solid organ transplant recipients (20/81, 25% and 141/458, 31%). SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were detected in 513 of 580 (88%) patients, with lower T cell magnitude or proportion in hemodialysis, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and liver transplant recipients (versus healthy controls). Humoral responses against Omicron (BA.1) were reduced, although cross-reactive T cell responses were sustained in all participants for whom these data were available. BNT162b2 was associated with higher antibody but lower cellular responses compared to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. We report 474 SARS-CoV-2 infection episodes, including 48 individuals with hospitalization or death from COVID-19. Decreased magnitude of both the serological and the T cell response was associated with severe COVID-19. Overall, we identified clinical phenotypes that may benefit from targeted COVID-19 therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p>Hey there! Ever wondered why some folks still feel sick after beating the COVID-19 bug? Our superhero scientists took a peek at tiny hamster lungs to find clues about this lingering illness called PASC. They found special lung cells that didn't grow properly, kind of like when you plant seeds but don't give them enough water. Plus, they discovered some other cool stuff happening inside the lungs which might help us learn how to make people feel better faster after COVID-19 hits them! Itâ€™s a big deal because it could lead to awesome treatments in the future!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 survivors often suffer from post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Current evidence suggests dysregulated alveolar regeneration as a possible explanation for respiratory PASC, which deserves further investigation in a suitable animal model. This study investigates morphological, phenotypical and transcriptomic features of alveolar regeneration in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian golden hamsters. We demonstrate that CK8+alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells occur following SARS-CoV-2-induced diffuse alveolar damage. A subset of ADI cells shows nuclear accumulation of TP53 at 6- and 14-days post infection (dpi), indicating a prolonged arrest in the ADI state. Transcriptome data show high module scores for pathways involved in cell senescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis in cell clusters with high ADI gene expression. Moreover, we show that multipotent CK14+airway basal cell progenitors migrate out of terminal bronchioles, aiding alveolar regeneration. At 14 dpi, ADI cells, peribronchiolar proliferates, M2-macrophages, and sub-pleural fibrosis are observed, indicating incomplete alveolar restoration. The results demonstrate that the hamster model reliably phenocopies indicators of a dysregulated alveolar regeneration of COVID-19 patients. The results provide important information on a translational COVID-19 model, which is crucial for its application in future research addressing pathomechanisms of PASC and in testing of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for this syndrome.</p>

                <p>Think about it like this: We've got a superhero shield called "mass vaccination" that stops lots of sickness from spreading around. But guess what? Some sneaky virus, SARS-CoV-2 (that's the one causing COVID), is trying to outsmart our shield by changing its shape often. Our team found a cool new way to boost your body's defense squad â€“ T-cells! They make special targets called HLA-EPs that are really good at catching different versions of SARS-CoV-2, even the tricky ones. We tried this on some "mice" with human immune parts and also on a type of monkey lady (female rhesus macaques). The coolest part? When we gave them both HLA-EPs and another super virus piece (RBDbeta), they were way better at fighting off the latest COVID versions than before. This is like making our vaccine even stronger!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Herd immunity achieved through mass vaccination is an effective approach to prevent contagious diseases. Nonetheless, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with frequent mutations largely evaded humoral immunity induced by Spike-based COVID-19 vaccines. Herein, we develop a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA-based T-cell-inducing antigen, which targeted three SARS-CoV-2 proteome regions that enriched human HLA-I epitopes (HLA-EPs). Immunization of HLA-EPs induces potent cellular responses to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in humanized HLA-A*02:01/DR1 and HLA-A*11:01/DR1 transgenic mice. Of note, the sequences of HLA-EPs are highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In humanized HLA-transgenic mice and female rhesus macaques, dual immunization with the LNP-formulated mRNAs encoding HLA-EPs and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant (RBDbeta) is more efficacious in preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Omicron BA.1 variants than single immunization of LNP-RBDbeta. This study demonstrates the necessity to strengthen the vaccine effectiveness by comprehensively stimulating both humoral and cellular responses, thereby offering insight for optimizing the design of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

                <p>Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 is characterized by diminished peripheral CD8+Î²7 integrin+T cells and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA response</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Imagine a bunch of friends who all caught COVID-19 but ended up feeling different months later - some just felt like they got over it quickly while others still weren't quite right, six months down the line. A group of scientists took a close look at what was going on inside their bodies to figure out why some folks were stuck in this 'long COVID' state. They found that those with lingering symptoms had more superhero-like cells (CD8+) who weren't moving where they should, and these guys also seemed to be overworking themselves a bit too much. Plus, there was an interesting mix-up going on in their bodies â€“ some proteins were being made that could point towards the virus still hanging around somewhere inside them. This cool research helps us understand why some people have this lasting COVID-19 hangover and points to new ways we might help everyone feel better sooner!

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Several millions of individuals are estimated to develop post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 condition (PASC) that persists for months after infection. Here we evaluate the immune response in convalescent individuals with PASC compared to convalescent asymptomatic and uninfected participants, six months following their COVID-19 diagnosis. Both convalescent asymptomatic and PASC cases are characterised by higher CD8+T cell percentages, however, the proportion of blood CD8+T cells expressing the mucosal homing receptor Î²7 is low in PASC patients. CD8 T cells show increased expression of PD-1, perforin and granzyme B in PASC, and the plasma levels of type I and type III (mucosal) interferons are elevated. The humoral response is characterized by higher levels of IgA against the N and S viral proteins, particularly in those individuals who had severe acute disease. Our results also show that consistently elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8 and IP-10/CXCL10 during acute disease increase the risk to develop PASC. In summary, our study indicates that PASC is defined by persisting immunological dysfunction as late as six months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including alterations in mucosal immune parameters, redistribution of mucosal CD8+Î²7Integrin+T cells and IgA, indicative of potential viral persistence and mucosal involvement in the etiopathology of PASC.</p>

                <p>Beta variant COVID-19 protein booster vaccine elicits durable cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants in non-human primates</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, this super fast-moving Omicron thing is getting more curious because even though we've given people extra shots to keep them safe, it seems like they might not be as effective as we want. Our team just discovered an awesome vaccine booster that's got a cool protein in it (think of it as a secret weapon) and can give your body super-strong protection against different versions of the virus for a really long time! We tested this on monkeys, and guess what? It works like a charm. Even after six months, our vaccine buddayer does an amazing job fighting off Omicron and its cousins. Plus, it helps create memory cells in your body to keep the virus away for good!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, despite the implementation of booster vaccination, has raised questions about the durability of protection conferred by current vaccines. VaccineÂ boosters that can induce broader and more durable immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. We recently reported that our Beta-containing protein-based SARS-CoV-2 spike booster vaccine candidates with AS03 adjuvant (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03) elicited robust cross-neutralizing antibody responses at early timepoints against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in macaques primed with mRNA or protein-based subunit vaccine candidates. Here we demonstrate that the monovalent Beta vaccine with AS03Â adjuvant induces durable cross-neutralizing antibody responses against theÂ prototype strain D614G as well as variants Delta (B.1.617.2), Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) and SARS-CoV-1, that are stillÂ detectable in all macaques 6 months post-booster. We also describe the induction of consistent and robust memory B cell responses, independent of the levels measured post-primary immunization. These data suggest that a booster dose with a monovalent Beta CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccine can induce robust and durable cross-neutralizing responses against a broad spectrum of variants.</p>

                <p>Severe COVID-19 patients have impaired plasmacytoid dendritic cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So imagine you've got a bunch of superhero cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs for short. They're like the body's own team captains against bad guys - in this case, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). When these pDCs sense infected cells getting attacked by the virus, they jump into action!

These cell captains stick close to the infected ones using something called integrins. Once they're there, they release special signals (called IFN-I/Î») that tell other cells to stop the virus from spreading and causing trouble. The closer these pDCs are to the infected cells, the stronger their defense!

Interestingly, our study found out that when someone is seriously sick with COVID-19, their body's superheroes aren't as quick or powerful. We think this might be a big reason why it's harder for them to fight off the virus. So, these pDC cells are pretty much vital in keeping us safe from SARS-CoV-2!

In short, our body has its own team of superheroes that work together to stop the virus. But if they aren't up and running properly, it can make dealing with COVID-19 tougher for some people. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Type I and III interferons (IFN-I/Î») are important antiviral mediators against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the predominant IFN-I/Î» source following their sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Mechanistically, this short-range sensing by pDCs requires sustained integrin-mediated cell adhesion with infected cells. In turn, pDCs restrict viral spread by an IFN-I/Î» response directed toward SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This specialized function enables pDCs to efficiently turn-off viral replication, likely via a local response at the contact site with infected cells. By exploring the pDC response in SARS-CoV-2 patients, we further demonstrate that pDC responsiveness inversely correlates with the severity of the disease. The pDC response is particularly impaired in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, we propose that pDC activation is essential to control SARS-CoV-2-infection. Failure to develop this response could be important to understand severe cases of COVID-19.</p>

                <p>Hey there! Imagine our body is like a superhero team fighting off the sneaky COVID-19 villain, but what happens when one of those heroes (let's call them immune cells) isn't able to fight as well? Well, we've got this story about someone who was already not at their best and ended up catching a tricky new version of the virus. Over time, tiny changes happened in the virus that let it slip past our body's defenses. We found out that some of these changes actually made it harder for certain superheroes (CD8 T cells) to kick COVID-19's butt. This shows us that when our heroes are a bit weak, the virus can get even better at causing trouble!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised hosts may result in novel variants with changed properties. While escape from humoral immunity certainly contributes to intra-host evolution, escape from cellular immunity is poorly understood. Here, we report a case of long-term COVID-19 in an immunocompromised patient with non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma who received treatment with rituximab and lacked neutralizing antibodies. Over the 318 days of the disease, the SARS-CoV-2 genome gained a total of 40 changes, 34 of which were present by the end of the study period. Among the acquired mutations, 12 reduced or prevented the binding of known immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I antigens. By experimentally assessing the effect of a subset of the escape mutations, we show that they resulted in a loss of as much as ~1% of effector CD8 T cell response. Our results indicate that CD8 T cell escape represents a major underappreciated contributor to SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, we're looking at this cool study where folks who beat COVID-19 are checked out a few months later to see if they still feel like their old selves or not. They found that the ones having some tough time with lingering symptoms (like feeling super tired all the time, getting winded easily, and even trouble sleeping) might be less active than those who're bouncing back just fine. It's like we've spotted a new clue on how to help COVID-19 survivors get their groove back - because being more active can do wonders for overall health!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The aim of this study was to determine whether Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) are associated with physical inactivity in COVID-19 survivors. This is a cohort study of COVID-19 survivors discharged from a tertiary hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Patients admitted as inpatients due to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March and August 2020 were consecutively invited for a follow-up in-person visit 6 to 11Â months after hospitalization. Ten symptoms of PASC were assessed using standardized scales. Physical activity was assessed by questionnaire and participants were classified according to WHO Guidelines. 614 patients were analyzed (age: 56â€‰Â±â€‰13Â years; 53% male). Frequency of physical inactivity in patients exhibiting none, at least 1, 1â€“4, and 5 or more symptoms of PASC was 51%, 62%, 58%, and 71%, respectively. Adjusted models showed that patients with one or more persistent PASC symptoms have greater odds of being physically inactive than those without any persistent symptoms (OR: 1.57 [95% CI 1.04â€“2.39],P=â€‰0.032). Dyspnea (OR: 2.22 [1.50â€“3.33],P<â€‰0.001), fatigue (OR: 2.01 [1.40â€“2.90],P<â€‰0.001), insomnia (OR: 1.69 [1.16â€“2.49],P=â€‰0.007), post-traumatic stress (OR: 1.53 [1.05â€“2.23],P=â€‰0.028), and severe muscle/joint pain (OR: 1.53 [95% CI 1.08â€“2.17],P=â€‰0.011) were associated with greater odds of being physically inactive. This study suggests that PASC is associated with physical inactivity, which itself may be considered as a persistent symptom among COVID-19 survivors. This may help in the early identification of patients who could benefit from additional interventions tailored to combat inactivity (even after treatment of PASC), with potential beneficial impacts on overall morbidity/mortality and health systems worldwide.</p>

                <p>Magnitude of venous or capillary blood-derived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response determines COVID-19 immunity</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Imagine your body is like a superhero squad fighting off COVID-19. These heroes are special T cells that only go after the bad guy, SARS-CoV-2. But we're not totally sure if they really help keep you safe. Our study checked out 447 people who gave blood to see how strong their COVID-battling squads were. Turns out, if your squad is pretty big and powerful, it's way less likely that the bad guy will make you sick! So keeping an eye on these heroes could tell us if we might get sick or not â€“ super useful for staying healthy!

**Abstract Update:** A study investigates whether our bodyâ€™s own defense teamâ€”specific T cells targeting SARS-CoV-2â€”acts like true protectors against COVID-19. By examining blood samples from 447 individuals over six months, researchers found that a stronger army of these T cells significantly lowers the risk of falling ill with COVID-19. A smaller force increases chances of infection by almost half. This insight is further supported by data on an additional group using a new test method. The findings suggest monitoring our internal defense team could predict health risks and monitor immunity effectively, offering hope for better management of the pandemic!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 are thought to protect against infection and development of COVID-19, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Here, we associated whole-blood-based measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-Î³-positive T cell responses with positive COVID-19 diagnostic (PCR and/or lateral flow) test results up to 6 months post-blood sampling. Amongst 148 participants donating venous blood samples, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response magnitude is significantly greater in those who remain protected versus those who become infected (P<â€‰0.0001); relatively low magnitude T cell response results in a 43.2% risk of infection, whereas high magnitude reduces this risk to 5.4%. These findings are recapitulated in a further 299 participants testing a scalable capillary blood-based assay that could facilitate the acquisition of population-scale T cell immunity data (14.9% and 4.4%, respectively). Hence, measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells can prognosticate infection risk and should be assessed when monitoring individual and population immunity status.</p>

                <p>The evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the emergence of new variant lineages that have exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of those variants were designated as variants of concern/interest (VOC/VOI) by national or international authorities based on many factors including their potential impact on vaccine-mediated protection from disease. To ascertain and rank the risk of VOCs and VOIs, we analyze the ability of 14 variants (614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron) to escape from mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies. The variants show differential reductions in neutralization and replication by post-vaccination sera. Although the Omicron variant (BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2) shows the most escape from neutralization, sera collected after a third dose of vaccine (booster sera) retain moderate neutralizing activity against that variant. Therefore, vaccination remains an effective strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <p>Effectiveness and protection duration of Covid-19 vaccines and previous infection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection in young adults</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, we've got some cool news for all the university students out there during Covid times. We checked on how well different Covid shots (like Pfizer and Moderna) work against getting sick with the delta variant - that sneaky virus everyone's been hearing about lately.

Turns out, after a couple of jabs, these vaccines can stop you from getting seriously ill most of the time (75% to be exact). But here's where it gets interesting: if someone already had Covid before and didn't get their shots yet, they were still pretty tough against catching it again.

Now, as time passes by - we're talking about half a year here - the superhero powers of these vaccines seem to fade a bit (like 29%!). Still, having had Covid or getting those shots makes you way better off than not doing anything at all.

So next time you hear "delta" and "Covid," remember that your shot can help keep things under control in the campus cafeteria too!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Data on effectiveness and protection duration of Covid-19 vaccines and previous infection against general SARS-CoV-2 infection in general populations are limited. Here we evaluate protection from Covid-19 vaccination (primary series) and previous infection in 21,261 university students undergoing repeated surveillance testing between 8/8/2021â€“12/04/2021, during which B.1.617 (delta) was the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant. Estimated mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and AD26.COV2.S effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection is 75.4% (95% CI: 70.5-79.5), 65.7% (95% CI: 61.1-69.8), and 42.8% (95% CI: 26.1â€“55.8), respectively. Among previously infected individuals, protection is 72.9% when unvaccinated (95% CI: 66.1â€“78.4) and increased by 22.1% with full vaccination (95% CI: 15.8â€“28.7). Statistically significant decline in protection is observed for mRNA-1273 (P<â€‰.001), BNT162b2 (P<â€‰.001), but not Ad26.CoV2.S (P=â€‰0.40) or previous infection (P=â€‰0.12). mRNA vaccine protection dropped 29.7% (95% CI: 17.9â€“41.6) six months post- vaccination, from 83.2% to 53.5%. We conclude that the 2-dose mRNA vaccine series initially offers strong protection against general SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the delta variant in young adults, but protection substantially decreases over time. These findings indicate that vaccinated individuals may still contribute to community spread. While previous SARS-CoV-2 infection consistently provides moderately strong protection against repeat infection from delta, vaccination yields a substantial increase in protection.</p>

                <p>SARS-CoV-2 antibody trajectories after a single COVID-19 vaccination with and without prior infection</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, we've got a lot of people getting sick from COVID-1 Wardens (SARS-CoV-2) and it's taking a while for everyone to get their shots - not fair at all! But here's the cool part: researchers are checking if just one shot can do enough magic in folks who already caught the bug, compared to two shots given straight away. They looked into three popular vaccines and found that people with a past virus encounter (yikes!) might not need an extra jab for protection. This could help us get more people shielded faster! So next time you hear "just one shot," know it's got some serious potential.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Given high SARS-CoV-2 incidence, coupled with slow and inequitable vaccine roll-out in many settings, there is a need for evidence to underpin optimum vaccine deployment, aiming to maximise global population immunity. We evaluate whether a single vaccination in individuals who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 generates similar initial and subsequent antibody responses to two vaccinations in those without prior infection. We compared anti-spike IgG antibody responses after a single vaccination with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the COVID-19 Infection Survey in the UK general population. In 100,849 adults median (50 (IQR: 37â€“63) years) receiving at least one vaccination, 13,404 (13.3%) had serological/PCR evidence of prior infection. Prior infection significantly boosted antibody responses, producing higher peak levels and/or longer half-lives after one dose of all three vaccines than those without prior infection receiving one or two vaccinations. In those with prior infection, the median time above the positivity threshold was >1 year after the first vaccination. Single-dose vaccination targeted to those previously infected may provide at least as good protection to two-dose vaccination among those without previous infection.</p>

                <p>Cross-reactive immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is low in pediatric patients with prior COVID-19 or MIS-C</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So, we've been looking at how kids who caught COVID before are dealing with new versions of the virus, especially this Omicron one. It turns out that only a few (like less than 10%!) have strong enough antibodies to fight it off compared to older ones or those vaccinated twice. Older kids get hit harder by these new viruses when they first catch them too. But here's the cool part: getting jabbed not just once but twice seems to give our little friends a better shield against all the nasty versions, including Omicron! This info is super important for keeping everyone safe and healthy as we face more virus changes in the future. So let's keep those vaccinations rolling out!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Neutralization capacity of antibodies against Omicron after a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents is not well studied. Therefore, we evaluated virus-neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants by age-stratified analyses (<5, 5â€“11, 12â€“21 years) in 177 pediatric patients hospitalized with severe acute COVID-19, acute MIS-C, and in convalescent samples of outpatients with mild COVID-19 during 2020 and early 2021. Across all patients, less than 10% show neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron. Children <5 years of age hospitalized with severe acute COVID-19 have lower neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants compared with patients >5 years of age. As expected, convalescent pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C cohorts demonstrate higher neutralization titers than hospitalized acute COVID-19 patients. Overall, children and adolescents show some loss of cross-neutralization against all variants, with the most pronounced loss against Omicron. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2 infection, children vaccinated twice demonstrated higher titers against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. These findings can influence transmission, re-infection and the clinical disease outcome from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and supports the need for vaccination in children.</p>

                <p>Adrenal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and adrenal findings in a post-mortem case series of patients with severe fatal COVID-19</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>When a person gets sick with COVID-19, their body sometimes goes haywire causing breathing problems and lots of inflammation, which can lead to serious issues or even death. Scientists are figuring out that the virus might also mess up an important part of your adrenal glands (those small organs near your kidneys), leading to more health troubles. They've found evidence showing how this happens in people with COVID-19, and it could mean doctors need to keep a close eye on these tiny but mighty glandular parts as patients recover from the virus.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Progressive respiratory failure and hyperinflammatory response is the primary cause of death in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite mounting evidence of disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in COVID-19, relatively little is known about the tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to adrenal glands and associated changes. Here we demonstrate adrenal viral tropism and replication in COVID-19 patients. Adrenal glands showed inflammation accompanied by inflammatory cell death. Histopathologic analysis revealed widespread microthrombosis and severe adrenal injury. In addition, activation of the glycerophospholipid metabolism and reduction of cortisone intensities were characteristic for COVID-19 specimens. In conclusion, our autopsy series suggests that SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the induction of adrenalitis. Given the central role of adrenal glands in immunoregulation and taking into account the significant adrenal injury observed, monitoring of developing adrenal insufficiency might be essential in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and during recovery.</p>

Instruction 2 (Much more difficult with added constraints):
</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>ObjectivesTo investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 causes morphological changes in the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (CSNP) of post-COVID-19 patients using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM).MethodsA total of 70 participants were included in the study and were divided into three groups. Post-COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations were considered Group 1 (n=â€‰24), and post-COVID-19 patients without neurological manifestations were considered Group 2 (n=â€‰24). Healthy control participants were considered Group 3 (n=â€‰22). The parameters of the CSNP, including nerve fibre density (NFD), nerve branch density (NBD), and nerve fibre length (NFL), were investigated in all participants using IVCM. Additionally, corneal sensitivity was tested by corneal esthesiometry.ResultsThe mean NFD, NBD, and NFL values of Group 1 (16.12â€‰Â±â€‰4.84â€‰fibre/mm2, 27.97â€‰Â±â€‰9.62â€‰branch/mm2, and 11.60â€‰Â±â€‰2.89â€‰mm/mm2) were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (19.55â€‰Â±â€‰3.01â€‰fibre/mm2, 40.44â€‰Â±â€‰7.16â€‰branch/mm2, and 15.92â€‰Â±â€‰2.08â€‰mm/mm2) and Group 3 (25.24â€‰Â±â€‰3.75â€‰fibre/mm2, 44.61â€‰Â±â€‰11.80â€‰branch/mm2, and 17.76â€‰Â±â€‰3.32â€‰mm/mm2) (p<â€‰0.05 for all). Except the mean NFD value (p<â€‰0.001), there were no significant differences in terms of the mean NBD and NFL values between Group 2 and Group 3 (p=â€‰0.445,p=â€‰0.085). The value of the mean corneal sensitivity was significantly higher in Group 3 (59.09â€‰Â±â€‰1.97â€‰mm) compared to Group 1 (55.21â€‰Â±â€‰1.02â€‰mm) and Group 2 (55.28â€‰Â±â€‰1.18â€‰mm) (p<â€‰0.001,p<â€‰0.001) but there was no significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 (p=â€‰1.000).ConclusionIn post-COVID-19 patients, the mean parameters of CSNP were lower than in the control group. These differences were more pronounced in patients who had neurological manifestations of COVID-19.</p>

                <p>SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant women in Scotland</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey, friends! So, we've got a bunch of moms in Scotland getting jabs against COVID-19 during their special times - you know, when they're expecting new kiddos. But guess what? Not as many are getting vaccinated compared to other ladies our age group. Here's the scoop:

Out of all the expectant moms who had babies in October 2021, around 1 out of every 56 didn't survive when their newborn got super sick with COVID-19, which is way higher than what we usually see (think 1 out of 87). And most worrisome? Almost all the moms who were unvaccinated ended up in hospitals or even critical care when they caught the virus.

The bottom line: It's super important for pregnant ladies to get their COVID-19 jab shots, not just to keep themselves healthy but also to protect their little ones during these tough times with the pandemic still going strong!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are lacking. We describe COVID-19 vaccine uptake and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in Scotland, using whole-population data from a national, prospective cohort. Between the start of a COVID-19 vaccine program in Scotland, on 8 December 2020 and 31 October 2021, 25,917 COVID-19 vaccinations were given to 18,457 pregnant women. Vaccine coverage was substantially lower in pregnant women than in the general female population of 18âˆ’44 years; 32.3% of women giving birth in October 2021 had two doses of vaccine compared to 77.4% in all women. The extended perinatal mortality rate for women who gave birth within 28â€‰d of a COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.6 per 1,000 births (95% CI 12.9âˆ’38.5; pandemic background rate 5.6 per 1,000 births; 452 out of 80,456; 95% CI 5.1âˆ’6.2). Overall, 77.4% (3,833 out of 4,950; 95% CI 76.2âˆ’78.6) of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 90.9% (748 out of 823; 95% CI 88.7âˆ’92.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with hospital admission and 98% (102 out of 104; 95% CI 92.5âˆ’99.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with critical care admission, as well as all baby deaths, occurred in pregnant women who were unvaccinated at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Addressing low vaccine uptake rates in pregnant women is imperative to protect the health of women and babies in the ongoing pandemic.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Ever heard about people getting super weird side effects after their COVID shots or catching the virus? Well, our smarty-pants team took a close look at it using huge numbers of folks who got vaccinated with ChAdOx1nCoV and BNT162b2 jabs, plus those who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 bug. They found that some people might get tingling hands (Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome) or one side of their face getting weirdly numb after certain vaccines within a month later. For example, with ChAdOx1nCoV, it's like for every 10 million shots given out, we might see about 38 extra cases of that tingling hand thing. And if you catch the virus but don't get jabbed yet? Well, there could be a whopping 145 more folks experiencing similar issues in just a month after testing positive! Pretty wild stuff to think about when deciding on vaccines or dealing with COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Emerging reports of rare neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection and vaccinations are leading to regulatory, clinical and public health concerns. We undertook a self-controlled case series study to investigate hospital admissions from neurological complications in the 28â€‰days after a first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (n=â€‰20,417,752) or BNT162b2 (n=â€‰12,134,782), and after a SARS-CoV-2-positive test (n=â€‰2,005,280). There was an increased risk of Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 2.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15â€“3.92 at 15â€“21â€‰days after vaccination) and Bellâ€™s palsy (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.08â€“1.56 at 15â€“21â€‰days) with ChAdOx1nCoV-19. There was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (IRR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12â€“1.71 at 15â€“21â€‰days) with BNT162b2. An independent Scottish cohort provided further support for the association between ChAdOx1nCoV and Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome (IRR, 2.32; 95% CI: 1.08â€“5.02 at 1â€“28â€‰days). There was a substantially higher risk of all neurological outcomes in the 28â€‰days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test including Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome (IRR, 5.25; 95% CI: 3.00â€“9.18). Overall, we estimated 38 excess cases of Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome per 10â€‰million people receiving ChAdOx1nCoV-19 and 145 excess cases per 10â€‰million people after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In summary, although we find an increased risk of neurological complications in those who received COVID-19 vaccines, the risk of these complications is greater following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.</p>

                <p>SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell memory is sustained in COVID-19 convalescent patients for 10 months with successful development of stem cell-like memory T cells</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! So you know how when we get sick with something and then later on, it's like our body has superhero cells ready to zap that germ? That's what happens with the virus called SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Scientists did a cool study where they checked out these heroes in people who got better from the sickness and found that even up to 300 days after feeling bad, their body was still full of them! These cells are super at fighting off the virus again and don't just disappear; some actually turn into other helpful types. This means they could help us if we get COVID-19 again or keep making our bodies strong against it with vaccines. Neat, right?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Memory T cells contribute to rapid viral clearance during re-infection, but the longevity and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells remain unclear. Here we conduct ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescent patients up to 317 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), and find that memory T cell responses are maintained during the study period regardless of the severity of COVID-19. In particular, we observe sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the proportion of stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells is increased, peaking at approximately 120 DPSO. Development of TSCMcells is confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of TSCMcells, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19, thus support the feasibility of effective vaccination programs as a measure for COVID-19 control.</p>

                <p>Temporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Checking out how many folks got COVID-19 and passed away shows that the numbers aren't too high in tropical Africa - but it still makes us wonder if people were passing it around a lot. A team checked for antibodies to the virus using blood tests from 9,000 Kenyans and found out: by September 1st of last year, there had been about 577 deaths across the country - and almost 1 in 20 people might've caught it. The number was even higher in Nairobi, where around 1 in 9 people could have the virus. It seems like COVID-19 has reached a bunch of people, but thankfully didn't cause many serious problems here!

"Updated Abstract: A recent study took a closer look at how common COVID-19 is in Kenya by testing thousands for antibodies and comparing it to the number of deaths. Even with lower numbers compared to other places, more than 20% of people might have had the virus, especially in Nairobi where almost 25% could be affected. This tells us that while not as bad as some countries, COVID-19 has definitely made its mark in Kenya.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Observed SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths are low in tropical Africa raising questions about the extent of transmission. We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG by ELISA in 9,922 blood donors across Kenya and adjusted for sampling bias and test performance. By 1st September 2020, 577 COVID-19 deaths were observed nationwide and seroprevalence was 9.1% (95%CI 7.6-10.8%). Seroprevalence in Nairobi was 22.7% (18.0-27.7%). Although most people remained susceptible, SARS-CoV-2 had spread widely in Kenya with apparently low associated mortality.</p>

                <p>Hey there! Imagine COVID-19 is like an unwanted guest causing trouble in your lungs, right? Well, our smart scientists have come up with tiny helpers called "ACE2 nanodecoys." They're like superhero shields made from special cells that line our lungs. These heroes can trap the bad guy (COVID-19) and protect us without causing any harm to our healthy lung cells!

These tiny helpers are so cool because they stay around in your lungs for more than 72 hours, giving them plenty of time to do their job. They've even been tested on animals like cute monkeys with COVID-19 and have helped clear out the virus while keeping their lungs safe from damage!

So now, we might just have a superhero treatment that can help people fight off this pesky coronavirus infection â€“ how awesome is that?</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has grown into a global pandemic, and only a few antiviral treatments have been approved to date. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a fundamental role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis because it allows viral entry into host cells. Here we show that ACE2 nanodecoys derived from human lung spheroid cells (LSCs) can bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and protect the host lung cells from infection. In mice, these LSC-nanodecoys were delivered via inhalation therapy and resided in the lungs for over 72â€‰h post-delivery. Furthermore, inhalation of the LSC-nanodecoys accelerated clearance of SARS-CoV-2 mimics from the lungs, with no observed toxicity. In cynomolgus macaques challenged with live SARS-CoV-2, four doses of these nanodecoys delivered by inhalation promoted viral clearance and reduced lung injury. Our results suggest that LSC-nanodecoys can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19.</p>

                <p>Sequential infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 aggravated COVID-19 pathogenesis in a mammalian model, and co-vaccination as an effective method of prevention of COVID-19 and influenza</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Winter's here and you don't want to catch both flu and COVID at the same time, right? Well, some researchers did a cool experiment where they gave mice two viruses, like getting hit by one punch after another. Turns out when these tiny critters got both the flu (H1N1) and COVID-19 shots at once, it took them longer to feel better, but didn't make things worse for us humans. They also tried giving animals a special combo shot that protects against both viruses - sounds like a winter superhero move! The study helps figure out if this combo could help keep everyone healthier during flu season and COVID-19 together.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Influenza A virus may circulate simultaneously with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to more serious respiratory diseases during this winter. However, the influence of these viruses on disease outcome when both influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 are present in the host remains unclear. Using a mammalian model, sequential infection was performed in ferrets and in K18-hACE2mice, with SARS-CoV-2 infection following H1N1. We found that co-infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 extended the duration of clinical manifestation of COVID-19, and enhanced pulmonary damage, but reduced viral shedding of throat swabs and viral loads in the lungs of ferrets. Moreover, mortality was increased in sequentially infected mice compared with single-infection mice. Compared with single-vaccine inoculation, co-inoculation of PiCoVacc (a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) and the flu vaccine showed no significant differences in neutralizing antibody titers or virus-specific immune responses. Combined immunization effectively protected K18-hACE2mice against both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings indicated the development of systematic models of co-infection of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, which together notably enhanced pneumonia in ferrets and mice, as well as demonstrated that simultaneous vaccination against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective prevention strategy for the coming winter.</p>

                <p>In this cool study, we checked out how our bodies fight off COVID-19 over time! We looked at lots of people who caught it and watched their immune system kick into high gear by making special fighters (antibodies) that can stop the virus from causing trouble. These superheroes showed up pretty fast, and they stuck around for a good whileâ€”up to 3 or 4 months! Plus, we found out that almost two-thirds of folks kept their body's defenders ready after getting sick too. So, even though it's still not totally clear how long the immune system keeps up its guard against COVID-19, this study says our bodies have a good shot at keeping us protected for quite some time!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The dynamics, duration, and nature of immunity produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear. Here, we longitudinally measured virus-neutralising antibody, specific antibodies against the spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the nucleoprotein (N) of SARS-CoV-2, as well as T cell responses, in 25 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients up to 121 days post-symptom onset (PSO). All patients seroconvert for IgG against N, S, or RBD, as well as IgM against RBD, and produce neutralising antibodies (NAb) by 14 days PSO, with the peak levels attained by 15â€“30 days PSO. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NAb remain detectable and relatively stable 3â€“4 months PSO, whereas IgM antibody rapidly decay. Approximately 65% of patients have detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+or CD8+T cell responses 3â€“4 months PSO. Our results thus provide critical evidence that IgG, NAb, and T cell responses persist in the majority of patients for at least 3â€“4 months after infection.</p>

To help us out, scientists have whipped up a cool gadget - think of it as a detective kit for viruses that's way better at finding those hidden culprits and other common germs we come across every day! This super tool can not only tell who might be sick but also give us the scoop on how many people are secretly carrying these bugs.

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The current practice for diagnosis of COVID-19, based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk, likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection. Serologic methods can more accurately estimate the disease burden by detecting infections missed by the limited testing performed to date. Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.</p>

                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! Ever wondered how our bodies deal with the sneaky SARS-CoV-2 virus? Well, scientists have taken a deep dive into this using non-human primates (think monkeys) and tracked their body's superhero cells from just after they catch the bug to four whole weeks later! They found some pretty cool cells that travel to the lungs like mini taxis. There are two types of these cells - one type seems to follow a trail of clues left by IL-6, and another sticks around for good, even when monkeys aren't feeling too hot.

As these tiny warriors move in and out of the lungs, some can tell us if the monkey is having a tough time with the virus. Interestingly, monkeys that seem to calm down their body's over-reaction show fewer problems. These superhero cell studies are not just fun facts; they could help scientists make better vaccines and treatments for us humans too!

**Update:** Scientists have taken a closer look at how our bodies respond to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using monkeys as their sidekicks. They discovered that certain cells are like emergency service teams, rushing into the lungs and even staying behind during recovery. Some of these heroes signal trouble when things get rough for our primate pals. It turns out, less drama in a monkey's body might mean smoother sailing - and this info is super important to help humans too!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Understanding SARS-CoV-2 associated immune pathology is crucial to develop pan-effective vaccines and treatments. Here we investigate the immune events from the acute state up to four weeks post SARS-CoV-2 infection, in non-human primates (NHP) with heterogeneous pulmonary pathology. We show a robust migration of CD16 expressing monocytes to the lungs occurring during the acute phase, and we describe two subsets of interstitial macrophages (HLA-DR+CD206âˆ’): a transitional CD11c+CD16+cell population directly associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and a long-lasting CD11b+CD16+cell population. Trafficking of monocytes is mediated by TARC (CCL17) and associates with viral load measured in bronchial brushes. We also describe associations between disease outcomes and high levels of cell infiltration in lungs including CD11b+CD16himacrophages and CD11b+neutrophils. Accumulation of macrophages is long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of disease. Interestingly, animals with anti-inflammatory responses including high IL-10:IL-6 and kynurenine to tryptophan ratios show less severe illness. Our results unravel cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 and suggest that NHP may be appropriate models to test immune therapies.</p>

                <p>Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors in the early COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey, it's like we're all playing this super intense game called COVID-19. But here's the catch: not everyone knows they got hit by this sneaky virus (SARS-CoV-2). We did some detective work and found out that in the Netherlands - a place really affected by it - about 3 out of every 100 folks had antibodies against this virus, even before we knew everyone's health. It turns out harder-hit places have more people with these sneaky proteins (up to almost 10%!). We also found that whether you're a guy or girl didn't matter when it came to catching the virus. The younger crowd, like teens and young adults, seemed to be getting hit more often. Our findings give us clues about how many people in the Netherlands have been exposed so far, even though everyone's staying at home for safety!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The world is combating an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with health-care systems, society and economies impacted in an unprecedented way. It is unclear how many people have contracted the causative coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) unknowingly and are asymptomatic. Therefore, reported COVID-19 cases do not reflect the true scale of outbreak. Here we present the prevalence and distribution of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a healthy adult population of the Netherlands, which is a highly affected country, using a high-performance immunoassay. Our results indicate that one month into the outbreak (i) the seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.7% with substantial regional variation, (ii) the hardest-hit areas showed a seroprevalence of up to 9.5%, (iii) the seroprevalence was sex-independent throughout age groups (18â€“72 years), and (iv) antibodies were significantly more often present in younger people (18â€“30 years). Our study provides vital information on the extent of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a country where social distancing is in place.</p>

                <p>A nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 for rapid neutralization testing and screening of anti-infective drugs for COVID-19</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>We've got this cool new gadget that can help find out if you're protected against COVID-1 Written by: [Your Name] Date: [Current Date] Introduction: Imagine a superfast test to check if your body is fighting off the bad germ causing COVID-19. We've invented it! Our new high-speed tool lets us quickly see how well antibodies in your blood can beat this virus by using tiny fireflies (nanoluciferase) that act just like a real SARS-CoV-2, the germ behind COVID-19. This nifty gadget works super fast - you'll know if itâ€™s working in just 5 hours! Plus, we used our tool to find out which medicines might help stop the virus from spreading by testing different drugs on them. The results? Some heroic meds like nelfinavir and rupintrivir really stepped up their game against SARS-CoV-2, while others just didn't do as well in this super speed test. So now we have a fast way to not only check if you're protected but also find potential fighters for the virus!</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>A high-throughput platform would greatly facilitate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serological testing and antiviral screening. Here we present a high-throughput nanoluciferase severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) that is genetically stable and replicates similarly to the wild-type virus in cell culture. SARS-CoV-2-Nluc can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera within 5â€‰hours, and it produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Additionally, using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2), we show that the assay can be used for antiviral screening. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluate a panel of antivirals and other anti-infective drugs, and we identify nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC500.77 to 2.74â€‰ÂµM). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10â€‰ÂµM. Collectively, this high-throughput platform represents a reliable tool for rapid neutralization testing and antiviral screening for SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                <p>Ocular conjunctival inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild COVID-19 in rhesus macaques</p>
                <p>ðŸ¤– <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hey there! We're looking into how SARS-CoV-2, yep that's the virus behind COVID-1ayer, can spread beyond just breathing. So we tried giving it to some monkeys with different ways like eye drops (kind of sneaky), a nose-to-lungs shot, and even down their gullets! Monkeys got this stuff in their eyes or noses within days, but only the lung-shot group had traces left further away. Those who got it through eating showed no signs at all - pretty cool! Our findings suggest that catching the virus from our tear ducts isn't impossible for monkeys too; we just need to explore how risky and what happens next when it takes different routes in more detail.</p>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmitted through the respiratory route, but potential extra-respiratory routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission remain uncertain. Here we inoculated five rhesus macaques with 1â€‰Ã—â€‰106TCID50of SARS-CoV-2 conjunctivally (CJ), intratracheally (IT), and intragastrically (IG). Nasal and throat swabs collected from CJ and IT had detectable viral RNA at 1â€“7 days post-inoculation (dpi). Viral RNA was detected in anal swabs from onlyÂ the IT group at 1â€“7 dpi. Viral RNA was undetectable in tested swabs and tissues after intragastric inoculation. The CJ infected animal had a higher viral load in the nasolacrimal system than the IT infected animal but also showed mild interstitial pneumonia, suggesting distinct virus distributions. This study shows that infection via the conjunctival route is possible in non-human primates; further studies are necessary to compare the relative risk and pathogenesis of infection through these different routes in more detail.</p>
