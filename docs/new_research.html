            <p>MULTI-SYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME (MIS-C) in children is linked to T cells with VŒ≤21.3+, showing heightened immune responses due to increased IL-18 from monocytes and NK cells after SARS-CoV-2 or other childhood infections.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a post-infectious presentation SARS-CoV-2 associated with expansion of the T cell receptor VŒ≤21.3+ T-cell subgroup. Here we apply muti-single cell omics to compare the inflammatory process in children with acute respiratory COVID-19 and those presenting with non SARS-CoV-2 infections in children. Here we show that in Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), the natural killer cell and monocyte population demonstrate heightened CD95 (Fas) and Interleuking 18 receptor expression. Additionally, TCR VŒ≤21.3+ CD4+ T-cells exhibit skewed differentiation towards T helper 1, 17 and regulatory T cells, with increased expression of the co-stimulation receptors ICOS, CD28 and interleukin 18 receptor. We observe no functional evidence for NLRP3 inflammasome pathway overactivation, though MIS-C monocytes show elevated active caspase 8. This, coupled with raised IL18 mRNA expression in CD16- NK cells on single cell RNA sequencing analysis, suggests interleukin 18 and CD95 signalling may trigger activation of TCR VŒ≤21.3+ T-cells in MIS-C, driven by increased IL-18 production from activated monocytes and CD16- Natural Killer cells.']</p>

            <p>A study shows that giving two doses of a certain COVID-19 shot soon after one dose significantly reduces the chances of young people catching or spreading Omicron BA.5, suggesting this approach should be used for vaccinating children and teens during widespread outbreaks.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['As SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants circulating globally since 2022, assessing the transmission characteristics, and the protection of vaccines against emerging Omicron variants among children and adolescents are needed for guiding the control and vaccination policies.', 'We\xa0conducted a retrospective cohort study for SARS-CoV-2 infections and close contacts aged <18 years from an outbreak seeded by Omicron BA.5 variants. The secondary attack rate (SAR) was calculated and the protective effects\xa0of two doses of inactivated vaccine (mainly Sinopharm /BBIBP-CorV) within a year versus one dose or two doses above a year after vaccination against the transmission and infection of Omicron BA.5 were estimated.', 'A total of 3442 all-age close contacts of 122 confirmed\xa0SARS-CoV-2 infections aged 0‚Äì17 years were included. The SAR was higher in the household setting and for individuals who received a one-dose inactivated vaccine or those who received a two-dose for more than one year, with estimates of 28.5% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 21.1, 37.7) and 55.3% (95% CrI: 24.4, 84.8), respectively. The second dose of inactivated vaccine conferred substantial protection against all infection and transmission of Omicron BA.5 variants within a year.', 'Our findings support the rollout of the second dose of inactivated vaccine for children and adolescents during the Omciron BA.5 predominant epidemic phase. Given the continuous\xa0emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, monitoring the transmission risk and corresponding vaccine effectiveness against\xa0SARS-CoV-2 variants among children and adolescents is important to inform control strategy.']</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>The SWITCH-ON study shows that bivalent booster shots are less effective against newer Omicron variants, suggesting a switch back to monovalent vaccines based on current strains for better protection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Waning antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination combined with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage led to reduced vaccine effectiveness. As a countermeasure, bivalent mRNA-based booster vaccines encoding the ancestral spike protein in combination with that of Omicron BA.1 or BA.5 were introduced. Since then, different BA.2-descendent lineages have become dominant, such as XBB.1.5, JN.1, or EG.5.1. Here, we report post-hoc analyses of data from the SWITCH-ON study, assessing how different COVID-19 priming regimens affect the immunogenicity of bivalent booster vaccinations and breakthrough infections (NCT05471440). BA.1 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines boosted neutralizing antibodies and T-cells up to 3 months after boost; however, cross-neutralization of XBB.1.5 was poor. Interestingly, different combinations of prime-boost regimens induced divergent responses: participants primed with Ad26.COV2.S developed lower binding antibody levels after bivalent boost while neutralization and T-cell responses were similar to mRNA-based primed participants. In contrast, the breadth of neutralization was higher in mRNA-primed and bivalent BA.5 boosted participants. Combined, our data further support the current use of monovalent vaccines based on circulating strains when vaccinating risk groups, as recently recommended by the WHO. We emphasize the importance of the continuous assessment of immune responses targeting circulating variants to guide future COVID-19 vaccination policies.']</p>

            <p>This study found four patient groups during COVID-19 based on their severity and antibody responses; delayed immune reactions linked to higher fatalities suggest an "Interferon paradox" hindering effective virus defense.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Plasma RNAemia, delayed antibody responses and inflammation predict COVID-19 outcomes, but the mechanisms underlying these immunovirological patterns are poorly understood. We profile 782 longitudinal plasma samples from 318 hospitalized patients with\xa0COVID-19. Integrated analysis using k-means reveals four patient clusters in a discovery cohort: mechanically ventilated critically-ill cases are subdivided into good prognosis and high-fatality clusters (reproduced in a validation cohort), while non-critical survivors segregate into high and low early antibody responders. Only the high-fatality cluster is enriched for transcriptomic signatures associated with COVID-19 severity, and each cluster has distinct RBD-specific antibody elicitation kinetics. Both critical and non-critical clusters with delayed antibody responses exhibit sustained IFN signatures, which negatively correlate with contemporaneous RBD-specific IgG levels and absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+T cell frequencies. These data suggest that the ‚ÄúInterferon paradox‚Äù previously described in murine LCMV models is operative in COVID-19, with excessive IFN signaling delaying development of adaptive virus-specific immunity.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants continue to be on a rampage worldwide. Several vaccines are being marketed to control their spread and reduce severity of symptoms in the affected. Various adverse events are being reported following the vaccine administration and therefore this systematic review investigated the oral adverse events post-COVID-19 vaccination.', 'A systematic search of five databases was conducted. Case reports, case series and observational studies describing oral lesions/oral adverse effects (outcome) following anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (exposure) in humans were included. Quality assessment of the studies was done using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. A working classification was developed from reported final diagnosis.', 'The systematic review included 18 individual cases. Majority of oral lesions occurred following BNT162b2 vaccination with average age of occurrence at 59.94 years. 67% of the affected individuals were female, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity.', 'Immune-mediated oral events have a propensity of occurrence following COVID-19 vaccination. mRNA-based vaccinations may have an affinity for causing oral adverse effects. It might be due to the immune dysregulation caused by these vaccinations.', 'The female, geriatric population and older individuals with co-morbidities might have an increased affinity to develop oral lesions post-COVID-19 vaccination.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['During a SARS-CoV-2 infection, macrophages recognize viral components resulting in cytokine production. While this response fuels virus elimination, overexpression of cytokines can lead to severe COVID-19. Previous studies suggest that the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 can elicit cytokine production via the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B and the toll-like receptors (TLRs). In this study, we found that: (i) S and the S2 subunit induceCXCL10, a chemokine implicated in severe COVID-19, gene expression by human macrophage cells (THP-1); (ii) a glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor attenuates this induction; (iii) S and S2 do not activate NF-Œ∫B but do activate the transcription factor IRF; (iv) S and S2 do not require TLR2 to elicit CXCL10 production or activate IRF; and (v) S and S2 elicit CXCL10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also discovered that the cellular response, or lack thereof, to S and S2 is a function of the recombinant S and S2 used. While such a finding raises the possibility of confounding LPS contamination, we offer evidence that potential contaminating LPS does not underly induced increases in CXCL10. Combined, these results provide insights into the complex immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest possible therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19.']</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>The study found that in Seattle from 2018 to 2 Habitat loss due to deforestation has been a significant problem affecting biodiversity, particularly for species with specialized habitat requirements like epiphytes. How does this process impact the diversity and distribution of epiphytic plant communities?
Answer: The loss of habitat caused by deforestation can greatly impact the diversity and distribution of epiphytic plant communities in several ways:

1. Reduced availability of suitable host trees: Epiphytes depend on host trees for support, nutrients, and access to light. When their habitats are destroyed, there may be fewer available host trees, leading to a decline in epiphytic species diversity and abundance.

2. Fragmented habitats: Deforestation can result in fragmented landscapes, which affects the dispersal and movement of pollinators, seed dispersers, and other organisms essential for maintaining healthy populations of epiphytes. This could lead to isolated pockets of epiphytic plants, reducing genetic diversity within species and limiting their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

3. Altered microclimates: Trees play an important role in regulating the local climate by providing shade, retaining water, and influencing humidity levels. The loss of trees can alter these microclimates, which could negatively impact epiphytic species that are sensitive to changes in light, temperature, or moisture conditions.

4. Increased competition for resources: As deforestation continues, the remaining vegetation may become more densely packed and compete for limited resources such as nutrients, water, and sunlight. This could lead to a shift in community composition, with generalists outcompeting specialized epiphytes.

5. Disruption of mutualistic relationships: Epiphytic plants often engage in symbiotic associations with other organisms (e.g., fungi, bacteria, and animals) that help them obtain nutrients and disperse their seeds. The destruction of host trees may also lead to the loss or decline of these mutualistic partners, which would affect epiphyte survival and distribution.

6. Increased vulnerability to climate change: As habitats are lost due to deforestation, many epiphytic plant species face an increased risk of being unable to adapt to changing environmental conditions caused by global warming. This can result in further population declines or even extinction for some species.

In summary, habitat loss from deforestation has significant consequences on the diversity and distribution of epiphyte communities as it directly affects their ability to survive and reproduce. The long-term impact may include decreased species richness, disrupted interactions between organisms, altered community composition, and increased vulnerability to climate change. Conservation efforts that focus on preserving forest habitats and restoring degraded areas are crucial for maintaining epiphyte diversity and ensuring the continued health of these unique plant communities.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Many studies have used mobile device location data to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, yet relationships between mobility behavior and endemic respiratory pathogens are less understood. We studied the effects of population mobility on the transmission of 17 endemic viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle over a 4-year period, 2018-2022. Before 2020, visits to schools and daycares, within-city mixing, and visitor inflow preceded or coincided with seasonal outbreaks of endemic viruses. Pathogen circulation dropped substantially after the initiation of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in March 2020. During this period, mobility was a positive, leading indicator of transmission of all endemic viruses and lagging and negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 activity. Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when restrictions relaxed but associations weakened in subsequent waves. The rebound of endemic viruses was heterogeneously timed but exhibited stronger, longer-lasting relationships with mobility than SARS-CoV-2. Overall, mobility is most predictive of respiratory virus transmission during periods of dramatic behavioral change and at the beginning of epidemic waves.']</p>

            <p>Glycosylation prevents furin cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, influencing viral infectivity; mutations confer glycosylation resistance or susceptibility, revealing a defense/evolutionary interplay between host and virus.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The multibasic furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of the spike protein is a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 and plays a crucial role in viral infection. However, the mechanism underlying furin activation and its regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that GalNAc-T3 and T7 jointly initiate clusteredO-glycosylations in the furin cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which inhibit furin processing, suppress the incorporation of the spike protein into virus-like-particles and affect viral infection. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the assembly of the spike protein into virus-like particles relies on interactions between the furin-cleaved spike protein and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a possible mechanism for furin activation. Interestingly, mutations in the spike protein of the alpha and delta variants of the virus confer resistance against glycosylation by GalNAc-T3 and T7. In the omicron variant, additional mutations reverse this resistance, making the spike protein susceptible to glycosylation in vitro and sensitive to GalNAc-T3 and T7 expression in human lung cells. Our findings highlight the role of glycosylation as a defense mechanism employed by host cells against SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on the evolutionary interplay between the host and the virus.']</p>

            <p>['Combination of waning immunity and lower effectiveness against new SARS-CoV-2 variants of approved COVID-19 vaccines necessitates new vaccines.

Primary safety and reactogenicity outcomes were unsolicited adverse events (AE) 28 days after each dose, solicited local and systemic AE 7 days after each dose, and serious AEs throughout the study. Primary immunogenicity outcome was the immune response as neutralizing antibodies 28 days after the second dose. Efficacy against COVID-19 was assessed as primary and secondary outcomes in phase 3b. ARCT-154 was well tolerated with generally mild‚Äìmoderate transient AEs. Four weeks after the second dose 94.1% (95% CI: 92.1‚Äì95.8) of vaccinees seroconverted for neutralizing antibodies, with a geometric mean-fold rise from baseline of 14.5 (95% CI: 13.6‚Äì15.5).

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the elderly, a high-risk group for severe COVID-19 infection, have not been fully understood. To clarify these issues, this prospective study followed up 157 elderly and 73 young participants for 16 months and compared the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of two doses of the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV followed by a booster dose of the recombinant protein vaccine ZF2001. The results showed that this vaccination protocol was safe and tolerable in the elderly. After administering two doses of the BBIBP-CorV, the positivity rates and titers of neutralizing and anti-RBD antibodies in the elderly were significantly lower than those in the young individuals. After the ZF2001 booster dose, the antibody-positive rates in the elderly were comparable to those in the young; however, the antibody titers remained lower. Gender, age, and underlying diseases were independently associated with vaccine immunogenicity in elderly individuals. The pseudovirus neutralization assay showed that, compared with those after receiving two doses of BBIBP-CorV priming, some participants obtained immunological protection against BA.5 and BF.7 after receiving the ZF2001 booster. Breakthrough infection symptoms last longer in the infected elderly and pre-infection antibody titers were negatively associated with the severity of post-infection symptoms. The antibody levels in the elderly increased significantly after breakthrough infection but were still lower than those in the young. Our data suggest that multiple booster vaccinations at short intervals to maintain high antibody levels may be an effective strategy for protecting the elderly against COVID-19.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Almost all the neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein show weakened or lost efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged or emerging variants, such as Omicron and its sub-variants. This suggests that highly conserved epitopes are crucial for the development of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we present one nanobody, N235, displaying broad neutralization against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype and multiple variants, including the newly emerged Omicron and its sub-variants. Cryo-electron microscopy demonstrates N235 binds a novel, conserved, cryptic epitope in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, which interferes with the RBD in the neighboring S protein. The neutralization mechanism interpreted via flow cytometry and Western blot shows that N235 appears to induce the S1 subunit shedding from the trimeric S complex. Furthermore, a nano-IgM construct (MN235), engineered by fusing N235 with the human IgM Fc region, displays prevention via inducing S1 shedding and cross-linking virus particles. Compared to N235, MN235 exhibits varied enhancement in neutralization against pseudotyped and authentic viruses in vitro. The intranasal administration of MN235 in low doses can effectively prevent the infection of Omicron sub-variant BA.1 and XBB in vivo, suggesting that it can be developed as a promising prophylactic antibody to cope with the ongoing and future infection.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['SARS-CoV-2 can re-structure chromatin organization and alter the epigenomic landscape of the host genome, but the mechanisms that produce such changes remain unclear. Here, we use polymer physics to investigate how the chromatin of the host genome is re-organized upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. We show that re-structuring of A/B compartments can be explained by a re-modulation of intra-compartment homo-typic affinities, which leads to the weakening of A-A interactions and the enhancement of A-B mixing. At the TAD level, re-arrangements are physically described by a reduction in the loop extrusion activity coupled with an alteration of chromatin phase-separation properties, resulting in more intermingling between different TADs and a spread in space of the TADs themselves. In addition, the architecture of loci relevant to the antiviral interferon response, such asDDX58orIFIT, becomes more variable within the 3D single-molecule population of the infected model, suggesting that viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity. Analysing the time trajectories of pairwise gene-enhancer and higher-order contacts reveals that this variability derives from increased fluctuations in the chromatin dynamics of infected cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 alters gene regulation by impacting the stability of the contact network in time.']</p>

            <p>['The rapid global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, with over a billion doses administered, has been unprecedented. However, in comparison to most identified clinical determinants, the implications of individual genetic factors on antibody responses post-COVID-19 vaccination for breakthrough outcomes remain elusive. Here, we conducted a population-based study including 357,806 vaccinated participants with high-resolution HLA genotyping data, and a subset of 175,000 with antibody serology test results. We confirmed prior findings that single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with antibody response are predominantly located in the Major Histocompatibility Complex region, with the expansive HLA-DQB1*06 gene alleles linked to improved antibody responses. However, our results did not support the claim that this mutation alone can significantly reduce COVID-19 risk in the general population. In addition, we discovered and validated six HLA alleles (A*03:01, C*16:01, DQA1*01:02, DQA1*01:01, DRB3*01:01, and DPB1*10:01) that independently influence antibody responses and demonstrated a combined effect across HLA genes on the risk of breakthrough COVID-19 outcomes. Lastly, we estimated that COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody positivity provides approximately 20% protection against infection and 50% protection against severity. These findings have immediate implications for functional studies on HLA molecules and can inform future personalised vaccination strategies.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Though pooling samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection has effectively met the need for rapid diagnostic and screening tests, many factors can influence the sensitivity of a pooled test. In this study, we conducted a simulation experiment to evaluate modes of pooling specimens and aimed at formulating an optimal pooling strategy. We focussed on the type of swab, their solvent adsorption ability, pool size, pooling volume, and different factors affecting the quality of preserving RNA by different virus solutions. Both quantitative PCR and digital PCR were used to evaluate the sampling performance. In addition, we determined the detection limit by sampling which is simulated from the virus of different titers and evaluated the effect of sample-storage conditions by determining the viral load after storage. We found that flocked swabs were better than fibre swabs. The RNA-preserving ability of the non-inactivating virus solution was slightly better than that of the inactivating virus solution. The optimal pooling strategy was a pool size of 10 samples in a total volume of 9\xa0mL. Storing the collected samples at 4\xa0¬∞C or 25\xa0¬∞C for up to 48\xa0h had little effect on the detection sensitivity. Further, we observed that our optimal pooling strategy performed equally well as the single-tube test did. In clinical applications, we recommend adopting this pooling strategy for low-risk populations to improve screening efficiency and shape future strategies for detecting and managing other respiratory pathogens, thus contributing to preparedness for future public health challenges.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a ‚Äòhighly transmissible respiratory pathogen, leading to severe multi-organ damage. However, knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular alterations is limited. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV-2 aberrantly elevates mitochondrial bioenergetics and activates the EGFR-mediated cell survival signal cascade during the early stage of viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 causes an increase in mitochondrial transmembrane potential via the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-nucleocapsid cluster, thereby abnormally promoting mitochondrial elongation and the OXPHOS process, followed by enhancing ATP production. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 activates the EGFR signal cascade and subsequently induces mitochondrial EGFR trafficking, contributing to abnormal OXPHOS process and viral propagation. Approved EGFR inhibitors remarkably reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation, among which vandetanib exhibits the highest antiviral efficacy. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with vandetanib decreases SARS-CoV-2-induced EGFR trafficking to the mitochondria and restores SARS-CoV-2-induced aberrant elevation in OXPHOS process and ATP generation, thereby resulting in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Furthermore, oral administration of vandetanib to SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 transgenic mice reduces SARS-CoV-2 propagation in lung tissue and mitigates SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation. Vandetanib also exhibits potent antiviral activity against various SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including alpha, beta, delta and omicron, in in vitro cell culture experiments. Taken together, our findings provide novel insight into SARS-CoV-2-induced alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and EGFR trafficking during the early stage of viral infection and their roles in robust SARS-CoV-2 propagation, suggesting that EGFR is an attractive host target for combating COVID-19.']</p>

            <p>['We aimed to determine SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity among pregnant women and the transplacental transfer efficiency of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies relative to malaria antibodies among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive mother-cord pairs. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Accra, Ghana, from March to May 2022. Antigen- specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (nucleoprotein and spike-receptor binding domain) and malarial antigens (circumsporozoite protein and merozoite surface protein 3) in maternal and cord plasma were measured by ELISA. Plasma from both vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women were tested for neutralizing antibodies using commercial kit. Of the unvaccinated pregnant women tested, 58.12% at antenatal clinics and 55.56% at the delivery wards were seropositive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and RBD antibodies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cord samples correlated with maternal antibody levels (N antigen rs=\u20090.7155,p<\u20090.001; RBD rs=\u20090.8693,p<\u20090.001). Transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibodies was comparable to circumsporozoite protein antibodies (p=\u20090.9999) but both were higher than transfer rates of merozoite surface protein 3 antibodies (p<\u20090.001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity among pregnant women in Accra is high with a boost of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG in vaccinated women. Transplacental transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and malarial antibodies was efficient, supporting vaccination of mothers as a strategy to protect infants against SARS-CoV-2.']</p>

            <p>['COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, affects neuronal cells, causing several symptoms such as memory loss, anosmia and brain inflammation. Curcuminoids (Me08 e Me23) and curcumin (CUR) are derived fromCurcuma Longa extract(EXT). Many therapeutic actions have been linked to these compounds, including antiviral action. Given the severe implications of COVID-19, especially within the central nervous system, our study aims to shed light on the therapeutic potential of curcuminoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in neuronal cells. Here, we investigated the effects of CUR, EXT, Me08 and Me23 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y. We observed that Me23 significantly decreased the expression of plasma membrane-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and TMPRSS11D, consequently mitigating the elevated ROS levels induced by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, Me23 exhibited antioxidative properties by increasingNRF2gene expression and restoring NQO1 activity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both Me08 and Me23 effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing ACE2 (SH-ACE2). Additionally, all of these compounds demonstrated the ability to decrease proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and IL-17, while Me08 specifically reduced INF-Œ≥ levels. Our findings suggest that curcuminoid Me23 could serve as a potential agent for mitigating the impact of COVID-19, particularly within the context of central nervous system involvement.']</p>

            <p>['Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases are more prone to Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, we genetically characterized Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in 633 ILI and SARI cases by rRT-PCR and WGS. ILI and SARI cases showed H1N1pdm09 prevalence of 20.9% and 23.2% respectively. 135 (21.3%) H1N1pdm09 and 23 (3.6%) H3N2 and 5 coinfection (0.78%) of H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed H1N1pdm09 resemblance to clade 6B.1A.5a.2 and their genetic relatedness to InfA/Perth/34/2020, InfA/Victoria/88/2020 and InfA/Victoria/2570/2019. Pan 24 HA and 26 NA nonsynonymous mutations and novel HA (G6D, Y7F, Y78H, P212L, G339R, T508K and S523T) and NA (S229A) mutations were observed. S74R, N129D, N156K, S162N, K163Q and S164T alter HA Cb and Sa antibody recognizing site. Similarly, M19T, V13T substitution and multiple mutations in transmembrane and NA head domain drive antigenic drift. SARS-CoV-2 strains genetically characterized to Omicron BA.2.75 lineage containing thirty nonsynonymous spike mutations exhibited enhanced virulence and transmission rates. Coinfection although detected very minimal, the mutational changes in H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 virus infected individuals could alter antibody receptor binding sites, allowing the viruses to escape immune response resulting in better adaptability and transmission. Thus continuous genomic surveillance is required to tackle any future outbreak.']</p>

            <p>['Molecular diagnostics involving nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are regarded as extremely functional tools. During the 2020 global health crisis, efforts intensified to optimize the production and delivery of molecular diagnostic kits for detecting SARS-CoV-2. During this period, RT-LAMP emerged as a significant focus. However, the thermolability of the reagents used in this technique necessitates special low-temperature infrastructure for transport, storage, and conservation. These requirements limit distribution capacity and necessitate cost-increasing adaptations. Consequently, this report details the development of a lyophilization protocol for reagents in a colorimetric RT-LAMP diagnostic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2, facilitating room-temperature transport and storage. We conducted tests to identify the ideal excipients that maintain the molecular integrity of the reagents and ensure their stability during room-temperature storage and transport. The optimal condition identified involved adding 5% PEG 8000 and 75\xa0mM trehalose to the RT-LAMP reaction, which enabled stability at room temperature for up to 28\xa0days and yielded an analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 83.33% and 90%, respectively, for detecting SARS-CoV-2. This study presents the results of a lyophilized colorimetric RT-LAMP COVID-19 detection assay with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity comparable to RT-qPCR, particularly in samples with high viral load.']</p>

Our findings revealed distinct seasonal patterns in NID incidence, with respiratory diseases showing the greatest response to PHSMs, while bloodborne and sexually transmitted diseases responded more moderately. 8 NIDs were identified as susceptible to PHSMs, including hand, foot, and mouth disease, dengue fever, rubella, scarlet fever, pertussis, mumps, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis. The termination of PHSMs did not cause NIDs resurgence immediately, except for pertussis, which experienced its highest peak in December 2023 since January 2008.

Attack rates of 45% and 57% were seen during Delta and Omicron BA.1 waves respectively. Eighty-four percent of RT-PCR-positive infections were asymptomatic. Children under 5-years had a lower incidence of infection than 18-49-year-olds. One prior SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced infection risk during the Delta wave only, with immunity from ‚â•2 prior infections required to reduce the risk of infection with early Omicron lineage viruses.

            <p>SARS-CoV-2's main protein is sensitive to oxygen levels, with a disulfide bond between key sites potentially preventing permanent damage and affecting its ability to form crystals under oxidized states.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for viral function and a key drug target. Mprois only active when reduced; turnover ceases upon oxidation but is restored by re-reduction. This suggests the system has evolved to survive periods in an oxidative environment, but the mechanism of this protection has not been confirmed. Here, we report a crystal structure of oxidized Mproshowing a disulfide bond between the active site cysteine, C145, and a distal cysteine, C117. Previous work proposed this disulfide provides the mechanism of protection from irreversible oxidation. Mproforms an obligate homodimer, and the C117-C145 structure shows disruption of interactions bridging the dimer interface, implying a correlation between oxidation and dimerization. We confirm dimer stability is weakened in solution upon oxidation. Finally, we observe the protein‚Äôs crystallization behavior is linked to its redox state. Oxidized Mprospontaneously forms a distinct, more loosely packed lattice. Seeding with crystals of this lattice yields a structure with an oxidation pattern incorporating one cysteine-lysine-cysteine (SONOS) and two lysine-cysteine (NOS) bridges. These structures further our understanding of the oxidative regulation of Mproand the crystallization conditions necessary to study this structurally.']</p>

            <p>['The present work elicits a novel approach to combating COVID-19 by synthesizing a series of azo-anchored 3,4-dihydroimidazo[4,5-b]indole derivatives. The envisaged methodology involves thel-proline-catalyzed condensation ofpara-amino-functionalized azo benzene, indoline-2,3-dione, and ammonium acetate precursors with pertinent aryl aldehyde derivatives under ultrasonic conditions. The structures of synthesized compounds were corroborated through FT-IR,1H NMR,13C NMR, and mass analysis data. Molecular docking studies assessed the inhibitory potential of these compounds against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, in silico investigations revealed significant inhibitory action surpassing standard drugs such as Remdesivir, Paxlovid, Molnupiravir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and (N3), an irreversible Michael acceptor inhibitor. Furthermore, the highly active compound was also screened for cytotoxicity activity against HEK-293 cells and exhibited minimal toxicity across a range of concentrations, affirming its favorable safety profile and potential suitability. The pharmacokinetic properties (ADME) of the synthesized compounds have also been deliberated. This study paves the way for in vitro and in vivo testing of these scaffolds in the ongoing battle against SARS-CoV-2.']</p>

            <p>['The ideal vaccines for combating diseases that may emerge in the future require more than simply inactivating a few pathogenic strains. This study aims to provide a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine effective against various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strains. To design the vaccine, a library of peptides from the spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope structural proteins of various strains was prepared. Then, the final vaccine structure was optimized using the fully protected epitopes and the fynomer scaffold. Using bioinformatics tools, the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties, population coverage, and secondary and three-dimensional structures of the vaccine candidate were evaluated. The bioinformatic analyses confirmed the high quality of the vaccine. According to further investigations, this structure is similar to native protein and there is a stable and strong interaction between vaccine and receptors. Based on molecular dynamics simulation, structural compactness and stability in binding were also observed. In addition, the immune simulation showed that the vaccine can stimulate immune responses similar to real conditions. Finally, codon optimization and in silico cloning confirmed efficient expression inEscherichia coli. In conclusion, the fynomer-based vaccine can be considered as a new style in designing and updating vaccines to protect against coronavirus disease.']</p>

            <p>['Whole virus-based inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide have been critical to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Although these vaccines are protective against homologous coronavirus infection, the emergence of novel variants and the presence of large zoonotic reservoirs harboring novel heterologous coronaviruses provide significant opportunities for vaccine breakthrough, which raises the risk of adverse outcomes like vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. Here, we use a female mouse model of coronavirus disease to evaluate inactivated vaccine performance against either homologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 or heterologous challenge with a bat-derived coronavirus that represents a potential emerging disease threat. We show that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide can cause enhanced respiratory disease during heterologous infection, while use of an alternative adjuvant does not drive disease and promotes heterologous viral clearance. In this work, we highlight the impact of adjuvant selection on inactivated vaccine safety and efficacy against heterologous coronavirus infection.']</p>

            <p>This study shows that young people, around a year post Omicron infection, have similar long Covid symptoms whether they were initially infected or reinfected with the virus.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Our previous study in children and young people (CYP) at 3- and 6-months post-infection showed that 12‚Äì16% of those infected with the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 met the research definition of Long Covid, with no differences between first-positive and reinfected CYP. The primary objective of the current study is to explore the impact of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection on young people 12 months post infection. 345 CYP aged 11‚Äì17\xa0years with a first laboratory-confirmed infection with the Omicron variant and 360 CYP reinfected with the Omicron variant completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, symptoms, and their impact shortly after testing and again at 3-, 6-and 12-months post-testing. Vaccination status was determined from information held at UKHSA. Comparisons between groups were made using chi-squared, Mann‚ÄìWhitney U, and Kruskal‚ÄìWallis tests. The most common symptoms in first-positive and reinfected CYP 12-months post-testing were tiredness (35.7 and 33.6% respectively) and sleeping difficulties (27.5 and 28.3% respectively). Symptom profiles, severity and impact were similar in the two infection status groups. Overall, by 12-months, 17.4% of first-positives and 21.9% of reinfected CYP fulfilled the research consensus Long Covid definition (p=\u20090.13). 12-months post Omicron infection, there is little difference between first-positive and reinfected CYP with respect to symptom profiles and impact. Clinicians may not therefore need to consider number of infections and type of variant when developing treatment plans. Further studies are needed to assess causality of reported symptoms up to 12-months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.']</p>

            <p>['The paucity of information on longevity of vaccine-induced immune responses and uncertainty of the correlates of protection hinder the development of evidence-based COVID-19 vaccination policies for new birth cohorts. Here, to address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a cohort study of healthy 5‚Äì12-year-olds vaccinated with BNT162b2. We serially measured binding and neutralizing antibody titers (nAbs), spike-specific memory B cell (MBC) and spike-reactive T cell responses over 1 year. We found that children mounted antibody, MBC and T cell responses after two doses of BNT162b2, with higher antibody and T cell responses than adults 6 months after vaccination. A booster (third) dose only improved antibody titers without impacting MBC and T cell responses. Among children with hybrid immunity, nAbs and T cell responses were highest in those infected after two vaccine doses. Binding IgG titers, MBC and T cell responses were predictive, with T cells being the most important predictor of protection against symptomatic infection before hybrid immunity; nAbs only correlated with protection after hybrid immunity. The stable MBC and T cell responses over time suggest sustained protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, even when nAbs wane. Booster vaccinations do not confer additional immunological protection to healthy children.']</p>

            <p>This study shows that people with Long COVID have fewer virus-fighting antibodies than others after recovery, possibly affecting their health further.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or the continuation of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) symptoms past 12\xa0weeks may affect as many as 30% of people recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) infection. The mechanisms regulating the development of PASC are currently not known; however, hypotheses include virus reservoirs, pre-existing conditions, microblood clots, immune dysregulation, as well as poor antibody responses. Importantly, virus neutralizing antibodies are essential for COVID-19 recovery and protection from reinfection but there is currently limited information on these immune regulators and associated cytokines in PASC patients. Understanding the key drivers of general and specific symptoms associated with Long COVID and the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies in PASC will aid in the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines which currently do not exist. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate systemic antibody and cytokine responses during COVID-19 recovery and PASC. In total, 195 participants were recruited in one of four groups: (1) Those who never had COVID-19 (No COVID); (2) Those in acute COVID-19 recovery (Acute Recovery) (4‚Äì12\xa0weeks post infection); (3) Those who recovered from COVID-19 (Recovered) (+\u200912\xa0weeks from infection); and (4) those who had PASC (PASC) (+\u200912\xa0weeks from infection). Participants completed a questionnaire on health history, sex, gender, demographics, experiences with COVID-19 acute and COVID-19 recovery/continuing symptoms. Serum samples collected were evaluated for antibody binding to viral proteins, virus neutralizing antibody titers, and serum cytokine levels using Ella SimplePlex Immunoassay‚Ñ¢ panels. We found participants with PASC reported more pre-existing conditions (e.g. such as hypertension, asthma, and obesity), and PASC symptoms (e.g. fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and shortness of breath) following COVID-19 than COVID-19 Recovered individuals. Importantly, we found PASC individuals to have significantly decreased levels of neutralizing antibodies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.1 variant. Sex analysis indicated that female PASC study participants had sustained antibody levels as well as levels of the inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF and ANG-2 over time following COVID-19. Our study reports people experiencing PASC had lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies; however, the results are limited by the collection time post-COVID-19 and post-vaccination. Moreover, we found females experiencing PASC had sustained levels of GM-CSF and ANG-2. With lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, this data suggests that PASC individuals not only have had a suboptimal antibody response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but may also have increased susceptibility to subsequent infections which may exacerbate or prolong current PASC illnesses. We also provide evidence suggesting GM-CSF and ANG-2 to play a role in the sex-bias of PASC. Taken together, our findings maybe important for understanding immune molecular drivers of PASC and PASC subgroups.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The Covid-19 pandemic outbreak has accelerated tremendous efforts to discover a therapeutic strategy that targets severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control viral infection. Various viral proteins have been identified as potential drug targets, however, to date, no specific therapeutic cure is available against the SARS-CoV-2. To address this issue, the present work reports a systematic cheminformatic approach to identify the potent andrographolide derivatives that can target methyltransferases of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. nsp14 and nsp16 which are crucial for the replication of the virus and host immune evasion. A consensus of cheminformatics methodologies including virtual screening, molecular docking, ADMET profiling, molecular dynamics simulations, free-energy landscape analysis, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA), and density functional theory (DFT) was utilized. Our study reveals two new andrographolide derivatives (PubChem CID: 2734589 and 138968421) as natural bioactive molecules that can form stable complexes with both proteins via hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The toxicity analysis predicts class four toxicity for both compounds with LD50value in the range of 500‚Äì700\xa0mg/kg. MD simulation reveals the stable formation of the complex for both the compounds and their average trajectory values were found to be lower than the control inhibitor and protein alone. MMGBSA analysis corroborates the MD simulation result and showed the lowest energy for the compounds 2734589 and 138968421. The DFT and MEP analysis also predicts the better reactivity and stability of both the hit compounds. Overall, both andrographolide derivatives exhibit good potential as potent inhibitors for both nsp14 and nsp16 proteins, however, in-vitro and in vivo assessment would be required to prove their efficacy and safety in clinical settings. Moreover, the drug discovery strategy aiming at the dual target approach might serve as a useful model for inventing novel drug molecules for various other diseases.']</p>

The GMT of anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 S-protein IgG antibody was 370.05 for S-268019-b versus 77.92 for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on Day 57 (GMT ratio [95% CI] 4.75 [4.34, 5.20]). Notably, immune responses were durable through the end of the study. S-268019-b elicited T-helper 1 skewed T-cell response, comparable to that of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. After the first dose, the incidence of solicited systemic treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was higher in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, but after the second dose, the incidence was higher in the S-268019-b group. Headache, fatigue, and myalgia were the most commonly reported solicited systemic TRAEs, while pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local TRAE following both doses in both groups. No serious treatment-related adverse serious TRAEs events were reported in the two groups. S-268019-b was more immunogenic than ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and was well tolerated (jRCT2051210151).']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variant strains with altered characteristics have emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir (RDV), a ribonucleotide analogue inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase, has become a valuable therapeutic agent. However, immunosuppressed hosts may respond inadequately to RDV and develop chronic persistent infections. A patient with respiratory failure caused by interstitial pneumonia, who had undergone transplantation of the left lung, developed COVID-19 caused by Omicron BA.5 strain with persistent chronic viral shedding, showing viral fusogenicity. Genome-wide sequencing analyses revealed the occurrence of several viral mutations after RDV treatment, followed by dynamic changes in the viral populations. The C799F mutation in nsp12 was found to play a pivotal role in conferring RDV resistance, preventing RDV-triphosphate from entering the active site of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The occurrence of diverse mutations is a characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, which mutates frequently. Herein, we describe the clinical case of an immunosuppressed host in whom inadequate treatment resulted in highly diverse SARS-CoV-2 mutations that threatened the patient‚Äôs health due to the development of drug-resistant variants.']</p>

            <p>['Developing a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for combatting the epidemic. Here, we investigated long-term immune responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 for the intranasal vaccination of a triple receptor-binding domain (RBD) scaffold protein (3R-NC) adjuvanted with a flagellin protein (KFD) (3R-NC+KFDi.n). In mice, the vaccination elicited RBD-specific broad-neutralizing antibody responses in both serum and mucosal sites sustained at high level over a year. This long-lasting humoral immunity was correlated with the presence of long-lived RBD-specific IgG- and IgA-producing plasma cells, alongside the Th17 and Tfh17-biased T-cell responses driven by the KFD adjuvant. Based upon these preclinical findings, an open labeled clinical trial was conducted in individuals who had been primed with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (IAV) vaccine. With a favorable safety profile, the3R-NC+KFDi.nboost elicited enduring broad-neutralizing IgG in plasma and IgA in salivary secretions. To meet the challenge of frequently emerged variants, we further designed an updated triple-RBD scaffold protein with mutated RBD combinations, which can induce adaptable antibody responses to neutralize the newly emerging variants, including JN.1. Our findings highlight the potential of the KFD-adjuvanted triple-RBD scaffold protein is a promising prototype for the development of a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['It is well known the potential of severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to induce post-acute sequelae, a condition called Long COVID. This syndrome includes several symptoms, but the central nervous system (CNS) main one is neurocognitive dysfunction. Recently it has been demonstrated the relevance of plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (pNfL), as a biomarker of early involvement of the CNS in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pNfL in patients with post-acute neurocognitive symptoms and the potential of NfL as a prognostic biomarker in these cases. A group of 63 long COVID patients ranging from 18 to 59 years-old were evaluated, submitted to a neurocognitive battery assessment, and subdivided in different groups, according to results. Plasma samples were collected during the long COVID assessment and used for measurement of pNfL with the Single molecule array (SIMOA) assays. Levels of pNfL were significantly higher in long COVID patients with neurocognitive symptoms when compared to HC (p=\u20090.0031). Long COVID patients with cognitive impairment and fatigue symptoms presented higher pNfL levels when compared to long COVID patients without these symptoms, individually and combined (p=\u20090.0263,p=\u20090.0480, and 0.0142, respectively). Correlation analysis showed that levels of cognitive lost and exacerbation of fatigue in the neurocognitive evaluation had a significative correlation with higher pNfL levels (p=\u20090.0219 and 0.0255, respectively). Previous reports suggested that pNfL levels are related with higher risk of severity and predict lethality of COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a long-term impact on the brain, even in patients who presented mild acute disease. NfL measurements might be useful to identify CNS involvement in long COVID associated with neurocognitive symptoms and to identify who will need continuous monitoring and treatment support.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (1 March\xa0to\xa010 May 2021) with an attack rate of 26.5% among approximately 1150 workers at a storage and distribution centre in England prompted a multidisciplinary outbreak investigation (5 May\xa0to\xa06 August 2021), with the aim of better understanding worker- and workplace-related risk factors for viral transmission in the warehousing sector. Overall, environmental factors (e.g., ventilation, humidity and temperature) were assessed to be appropriate at the facility. Nevertheless, 39 (51.3%) surface samples from across the site tested positive for low/ very low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct value\u2009‚â•\u200932.0 for all). Among the study participants, of whom 35.6% were confirmed or suspected cases, 95.5% reported having received COVID-19 prevention training, 100.0% reported handwashing, and 80.0% reported use of face coverings at work. Notably, 43.9% and 19.0% reported working with a symptomatic and a positive contact respectively. Furthermore, 80.5% and 46.3% had concerns regarding reduction in their income and future unemployment, respectively, due to self-isolation. The findings of this study suggest that, in addition to targeted workplace infection control measures and tailored work area specific risk assessments, an enhanced and equitable sick leave policy may help limit presenteeism and viral transmission in large workplaces.']</p>

            <p>['Immunization via the respiratory route is predicted to increase the effectiveness of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of one or two doses of a live-attenuated murine pneumonia virus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike protein (MPV/S-2P), delivered intranasally/intratracheally to male rhesus macaques. A single dose of MPV/S-2P is highly immunogenic, and a second dose increases the magnitude and breadth of the mucosal and systemic anti-S antibody responses and increases levels of dimeric anti-S IgA in the airways. MPV/S-2P also induces S-specific CD4+and CD8+T-cells in the airways that differentiate into large populations of tissue-resident memory cells within a month after the boost. One dose induces substantial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and two doses of MPV/S-2P are fully protective against SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus replication in the airways. A prime/boost immunization with a mucosally-administered live-attenuated MPV vector could thus be highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.']</p>

            <p>['Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing outbreak, disrupting human life worldwide. Vaccine development was prioritized to obtain a biological substance for combating the viral pathogen and lessening disease severity. In vaccine production, biological origin and relevant materials must be carefully examined for potential contaminants in conformity with good manufacturing practice. Due to fast mutation, several SARS-CoV-2 variants and sublineages have been identified. Currently, most of COVID-19 vaccines are developed based on the protein sequence of the Wuhan wild type strain. New vaccines specific for emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously needed to tackle the incessant evolution of the virus. Therefore, in vaccine development and production, a reliable method to identify the nature of subunit vaccines is required to avoid cross-contamination. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using quadrupole-time of flight along with tryptic digestion was developed for distinguishing protein materials derived from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. After analyzing the recombinantly produced receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nine characteristic peptides were identified with acceptable limits of detection. They can be used together to distinguish 14 SARS-CoV-2 strains, except Kappa and Epsilon. Plant-produced RBD-Fc protein derived from Omicron strains can be easily distinguished from the others with 4‚Äì5 unique peptides. Eventually, a peptide key was developed based on the nine peptides, offering a prompt and precise flowchart to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 strain identification in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing.']</p>

            <p>['An improved understanding of the underlying physicochemical properties of respiratory aerosol that influence viral infectivity may open new avenues to mitigate the transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that an increase in the pH of respiratory aerosols following generation due to changes in the gas-particle partitioning of pH buffering bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide is a significant factor in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We show here that a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 aerostability results from a moderate increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (e.g. 800 ppm), an effect that is more marked than that observed for changes in relative humidity. We model the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission on the ambient concentration of CO2, concluding that even this moderate increase in CO2concentration results in a significant increase in overall risk. These observations confirm the critical importance of ventilation and maintaining low CO2concentrations in indoor environments for mitigating disease transmission. Moreover, the correlation of increased CO2concentration with viral aerostability need to be better understood when considering the consequences of increases in ambient CO2levels in our atmosphere.']</p>

            <p>['Inflammasome assembly is a potent mechanism responsible for the host protection against pathogens, including viruses. When compromised, it can allow viral replication, while when disrupted, it can perpetuate pathological responses by IL-1 signaling and pyroptotic cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to activate inflammasome in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, however, potential mechanisms responsible for this response are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of ORF3a, E and M SARS-CoV-2 viroporins in the inflammasome activation in major populations of alveolar sentinel cells: macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells. We demonstrated that each viroporin is capable of activation of the inflammasome in macrophages to trigger pyroptosis-like cell death and IL-1Œ±release from epithelial and endothelial cells. Small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors reduced IL-1 release but weakly affected the pyroptosis. Importantly, we discovered that while SARS-CoV-2 could not infect the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells it induced IL-1Œ±and IL-33 release. Together, these findings highlight the essential role of macrophages as the major inflammasome-activating cell population in the lungs and point to endothelial cell expressed IL-1Œ±as a potential novel component driving the pulmonary immunothromobosis in COVID-19.']</p>

            <p>['The individual results of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests measured after the first pandemic wave of 2020 cannot be directly interpreted as a probability of having been infected. Plus, these results are usually returned as a binary or ternary variable, relying on predefined cut-offs. We propose a Bayesian mixture model to estimate individual infection probabilities, based on 81,797 continuous anti-spike IgG tests from Euroimmun collected in France after the first wave. This approach used serological results as a continuous variable, and was therefore not based on diagnostic cut-offs. Cumulative incidence, which is necessary to compute infection probabilities, was estimated according to age and administrative region. In France, we found that a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù or a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù test, as classified by the manufacturer, could correspond to a probability of infection as high as 61.8% or as low as 67.7%, respectively. ‚ÄúIndeterminate‚Äù tests encompassed probabilities of infection ranging from 10.8 to 96.6%. Our model estimated tailored individual probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on age, region, and serological result.
