            <p>['Persistent acute SARS-CoV- 2 infection is characterised by the persistence of symptoms of a COVID-19 illness and a persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR result. It is often seen in immunocompromised individuals. Currently, there are no approved treatment regimens or guidelines for management.', 'Our patient is a middle-aged male who had received chemotherapy prior to the onset of his SARS- CoV-2 infection and subsequently was diagnosed with a persistent and acute SARS- CoV-2 infection after presenting to us with a pyrexia of unknown origin. He was treated on an off-label basis following informed consent with casirivimab-imdevimab monoclonal antibody therapy, comprising two IgG1 neutralising human monoclonal antibodies at a dose of 600\u2009mg each.', 'Our patient had significant clinical improvement on treatment with the monoclonal antibody therapy and it was well tolerated without any adverse effects. He is currently doing well during follow up.', 'Casirivimab-imdevimab monoclonal antibody therapy could be beneficial for people with persistent acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therapy is warranted on a case-to-case basis. This highlights the need to identify immunocompromised individuals who are at risk of developing persistent acute SARS-CoV-2 infection to enable their prompt treatment.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>["The COVID-19 has had a significant influence on people's lives across the world. The viral genome has undergone numerous unanticipated changes that have given rise to new varieties, raising alarm on a global scale. Bioactive phytochemicals derived from nature and synthetic sources possess lot of potential as pathogenic virus inhibitors. The goal of the recent study is to report new inhibitors of Schiff bases of 1,3-dipheny urea derivatives against SARS COV-2 spike protein through in-vitro and in-silico approach. Total 14 compounds were evaluated, surprisingly, all the compounds showed strong inhibition with inhibitory values between 79.60% and 96.00% inhibition. Here, compounds3a(96.00%),3d(89.60%),3e(84.30%),3f(86.20%),3g(88.30%),3h(86.80%),3k(82.10%),3l(90.10%),3m(93.49%),3n(85.64%), and3o(81.79%) exhibited high inhibitory potential against SARS COV-2 spike protein. While3calso showed significant inhibitory potential with 79.60% inhibition. The molecular docking of these compounds revealed excellent fitting of molecules in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with good interactions with the key residues of RBD and docking scores ranging from ‚àí\xa04.73 to ‚àí\xa05.60\xa0kcal/mol. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation for 150\xa0ns indicated a strong stability of a complex 3a:6MOJ. These findings obtained from the in-vitro and in-silico study reflect higher potency of the Schiff bases of 1,3-diphenyl urea derivatives. Furthermore, also highlight their medicinal importance for the treatment of SARS COV-2 infection. Therefore, these small molecules could be a possible drug candidate."]</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on England showed a sharp decrease in severe infections from January 2021 to December 2022 with fluctuations due to various factors since April 2022.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The COVID-19 pandemic led to 231,841 deaths and 940,243 hospitalisations in England, by the end of March 2023. This paper calculates the real-time infection hospitalisation risk (IHR) and infection fatality risk (IFR) using the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus Infection Survey (ONS CIS) and the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission Survey between November 2020 to March 2023. The IHR and the IFR in England peaked in January 2021 at 3.39% (95% Credible Intervals (CrI): 2.79, 3.97) and 0.97% (95% CrI: 0.62, 1.36), respectively. After this time, there was a rapid decline in the severity from infection, with the lowest estimated IHR of 0.32% (95% CrI: 0.27, 0.39) in December 2022 and IFR of 0.06% (95% CrI: 0.04, 0.08) in April 2022. We found infection severity to vary more markedly between regions early in the pandemic however, the absolute heterogeneity has since reduced. The risk from infection of SARS-CoV-2 has changed substantially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with a decline of 86.03% (80.86, 89.35) and 89.67% (80.18, 93.93) in the IHR and IFR, respectively, since early 2021. From April 2022 until March 2023, the end of the ONS CIS study, we found fluctuating patterns in the severity of infection with the resumption of more normative mixing, resurgent epidemic waves, patterns of waning immunity, and emerging variants that have shown signs of convergent evolution.']</p>

            <p>A study used genetically altered mice with human ACE2 and TMPRSS2, showing these double-transgenic mice are very susceptible to COVID-19, but treatments like nafamostat can reduce disease severity; this model helps understand virus effects and test drugs.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Mouse models expressing human ACE2 for coronavirus disease 2019 have been frequently used to understand its pathogenesis and develop therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. Given that human TMPRSS2 supports viral entry, replication, and pathogenesis, we established a double-transgenic mouse model expressing both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-overexpression of both genes increased viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo. Double-transgenic mice showed significant body weight loss, clinical disease symptoms, acute lung injury, lung inflammation, and lethality in response to viral infection, indicating that they were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Pretreatment with the TMPRSS2 inhibitor, nafamostat, effectively reduced virus-induced weight loss, viral replication, and mortality in the double-transgenic mice. Moreover, the susceptibility and differential pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 variants were demonstrated in this animal model. Together, our results demonstrate that double-transgenic mice could provide a highly susceptible mouse model for viral infection to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evaluate antiviral therapeutics against coronavirus disease 2019.']</p>

            <p>This study shows how the COVID-19 virus creates tiny structures to copy its genetic material within cells, which change over time and might help design new treatments.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The SARS-CoV-2 viral infection transforms host cells and produces special organelles in many ways, and we focus on the replication organelles, the sites of replication of viral genomic RNA (vgRNA). To date, the precise cellular localization of key RNA molecules and replication intermediates has been elusive in electron microscopy studies. We use super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and specific labeling to reveal the nanoscopic organization of replication organelles that contain numerous vgRNA molecules along with the replication enzymes and clusters of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We show that the replication organelles are organized differently at early and late stages of infection. Surprisingly, vgRNA accumulates into distinct globular clusters in the cytoplasmic perinuclear region, which grow and accommodate more vgRNA molecules as infection time increases. The localization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers and nsp3 (a component of the double-membrane vesicle, DMV) at the periphery of the vgRNA clusters suggests that replication organelles are encapsulated into DMVs, which have membranes derived from the host ER. These organelles merge into larger vesicle packets as infection advances. Precise co-imaging of the nanoscale cellular organization of vgRNA, dsRNA, and viral proteins in replication organelles of SARS-CoV-2 may inform therapeutic approaches that target viral replication and associated processes.']</p>

            <p>['Wastewater surveillance is an effective tool for monitoring community spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis for wastewater surveillance is more susceptible  to mutations in target genome regions\xa0than binary PCR analysis for clinical surveillance. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater estimated by N1 and N2 qPCR assays started to diverge around July 2022 in data from different sampling sites, analytical methods, and analytical laboratories in Japan. On the basis of clinical genomic surveillance data and experimental data, we demonstrate that the divergence is due to two mutations in the N1 probe region, which can cause underestimation of viral concentrations. We further show that this inaccuracy can be alleviated if the qPCR data are analyzed with the second derivative method or the Cy0 method instead of the crossing point method.']</p>

Risks of these sequelae have been characterized up to 2\u2009years after infection, but longer-term follow-up is limited. Here we built a cohort of 135,161 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 5,206,835 controls from the US Department of Veterans Affairs who were followed for 3\u2009years to estimate risks of death and PASC. Among non-hospitalized individuals, the increased risk of death was no longer present after the first year of infection, and risk of incident PASC declined over the 3\u2009years but still contributed 9.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4‚Äì18.7) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1,000 persons in the third year. Among hospitalized individuals, risk of death declined but remained significantly elevated in the third year after infection (incidence rate ratio: 1.29 (95% CI: 1.19‚Äì1.40)). Risk of incident PASC declined over the 3\u2009years, but substantial residual risk remained in the third year, leading to 90.0 (95% CI: 55.2‚Äì124.8) DALYs per 1,000 persons. Altogether, our findings show reduction of risks over time, but the burden of mortality and health loss remains in the third year among hospitalized individuals.']</p>

However, a comprehensive understanding of how this virus can induce vascular complications remains lacking. Here, we show that a peptide fragment of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, S192 (sequence 192-211), is capable of forming amyloid-like aggregates that can induce agglutination of red blood cells, which was not observed with low- and non-aggregated S192 peptide. We subsequently screened eight amyloid-binding molecules and identified BAM1-EG6, a benzothiazole amphiphile, as a promising candidate capable of binding to aggregated S192 and partially inhibiting its agglutination activity. These results provide new insight into a potential molecular mechanism for the capability of spike protein metabolites to contribute to COVID-19-related blood complications and suggest a new therapeutic approach for combating microvascular morbidities in COVID-19 patients.']</p>

            <p>['The immunoprotective components control COVID-19 disease severity, as well as long-term adaptive immunity maintenance and subsequent reinfection risk discrepancies across initial COVID-19 severity, remain unclarified. Here, we longitudinally analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific immune effectors during the acute infection and convalescent phases of 165 patients with COVID-19 categorized by severity. We found that early and robust SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T cell responses ameliorate disease progression and shortened hospital stay, while delayed and attenuated virus-specific CD8+T cell responses are prominent severe COVID-19 features. Delayed antiviral antibody generation rather than titer level associates with severe outcomes. Conversely, initial COVID-19 severity imprints the long-term maintenance of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity, demonstrating that severe convalescents exhibited more sustained virus-specific antibodies and memory T cell responses compared to mild/moderate counterparts. Moreover, initial COVID-19 severity inversely correlates with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk. Overall, our study unravels the complicated interaction between temporal characteristics of virus-specific T cell responses and COVID-19 severity to guide future SARS-CoV-2 wave management.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) based on wavefield propagation has been established as a high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging modality, suitable to reconstruct the intricate structure of soft tissues, and the corresponding pathological alterations. However, for biomedical research, more is needed than 3D visualisation and rendering of the cytoarchitecture in a few selected cases. First, the throughput needs to be increased to cover a statistically relevant number of samples. Second, the cytoarchitecture has to be quantified in terms of morphometric parameters, independent of visual impression. Third, dimensionality reduction and classification are required for identification of effects and interpretation of results. To address these challenges, we here design and implement a novel integrated and high throughput XPCT imaging and analysis workflow for 3D histology, pathohistology and drug testing. Our approach uses semi-automated data acquisition, reconstruction and statistical quantification. We demonstrate its capability for the example of lung pathohistology in Covid-19. Using a small animal model, different Covid-19 drug candidates are administered after infection and tested in view of restoration of the physiological cytoarchitecture, specifically the alveolar morphology. To this end, we then use morphometric parameter determination followed by a dimensionality reduction and classification based on optimal transport. This approach allows efficient discrimination between physiological and pathological lung structure, thereby providing quantitative insights into the pathological progression and partial recovery due to drug treatment. Finally, we stress that the XPCT image chain implemented here only used synchrotron radiation for validation, while the data used for analysis was recorded with laboratory\\(\\mu\\)CT radiation, more easily accessible for pre-clinical research.']</p>

            <p>['SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Timely and accurate diagnostic testing is vital to contain the spread of infection, reduce delays in treatment and care, and inform patient management. Optimal specimen type (e.g. nasal swabs or saliva), timing of sampling, viral marker assayed (RNA or antigen), and correlation with viral infectivity and COVID-19 symptoms severity remain incompletely defined. We conducted a field study to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 viral marker kinetics starting from very early times after infection. We measured RNA and antigen levels in nasal swabs and saliva, virus outgrowth in cell culture from nasal swabs, and antibody levels in blood in a cohort of 30 households. Nine household contacts (HHC) became infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the study. Viral RNA was detected in saliva specimens approximately 1‚Äì2\xa0days before nasal swabs in six HHC. Detection of RNA was more sensitive than of antigen, but antigen detection was better correlated with culture positivity, a proxy for contagiousness. Anti-nucleocapsid antibodies peaked one to three weeks post-infection. Viral RNA and antigen levels were higher in specimens yielding replication competent virus in cell culture. This study provides important data that can inform how to optimally interpret SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test results.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Previous studies through targeted mutagenesis of K-D-K-E motif have demonstrated that 2‚Ä≤-O-MTase activity is essential for efficient viral replication and immune evasion. However, the K-D-K-E catalytic motif of 2‚Ä≤-O-MTase is highly conserved across numerous viruses, including flaviviruses, vaccinia viruses, coronaviruses, and extends even to mammals. Here, we observed a stronger 2‚Ä≤-O-MTase activity in SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV, despite the presence of a consistently active catalytic center. We further identified critical residues (Leu-36, Asn-138 and Ile-153) which served as determinants of discrepancy in 2‚Ä≤-O-MTase activity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. These residues significantly enhanced the RNA binding affinity of 2‚Ä≤-O-MTase and boosted its versatility toward RNA substrates. Of interest, a triple substitution (Leu36‚Üí\u2009Ile36, Asn138‚Üí\u2009His138, Ile153‚Üí\u2009Leu153, from SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV) within nsp16 resulted in a proportional reduction in viral 2‚Ä≤-O-methylation and impaired viral replication. Furthermore, it led to a significant upregulation of type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory cytokines both in vitro andvivo, relying on the cooperative sensing of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that alterations in residues other than K-D-K-E of 2‚Ä≤-O-MTase may affect viral replication and subsequently influence pathogenesis. Monitoring changes in nsp16 residues is crucial as it may aid in identifying and assessing future alteration in viral pathogenicity resulting from natural mutations occurring in nsp16.']</p>

We have asked patients with MS about their willingness to receive recommended standard vaccinations pre-pandemically since June 2019. Between 10/2021 and 01/2022, we surveyed 193 of these MS patients about their current SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status, their perception of vaccination-related SEs, and reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 75.6% of the patients declared their willingness to receive standard vaccinations before the pandemic. 84.5%, 78.2%, and 13.0% of the patients had received the first, second, and third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, respectively, until the follow-up survey. The most common reason for not getting vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 was concern about possible side effects (82.1%), followed by the belief that the vaccines had not been adequately tested (64.3%). Vaccination-related SEs were reported by 52.8% of the patients. Younger age, higher education, lower degree of disability, relapsing disease course, shorter disease duration, not receiving a disease-modifying therapy and higher anxiety and depression levels were associated with the occurrence of certain vaccination-related SEs. Concerns about novel vaccines are widespread among MS patients and necessitate targeted education of the patients, especially to those with more severe psychopathological symptoms (anxiety or depression) and those who are generally skeptical of vaccination.']</p>

Original Title: "Crykey: Rapid Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Cryptic Mutations in Wastewater"

Shortened Version: "Crykey: Fast Spotting of COVID Mutations in Wastewater Samples"


Here's why this version maintains the essence and is suitable for a general audience:

1. **Simplified language** - I replaced terms like 'Rapid Identification,' which could be confusing, with 'Fast Spotting', making it easier to understand.

2. **Abbreviated technical term** - Instead of "Cryptic Mutations," the phrase "Mutations" is used as it's a more common way for people to refer to changes in viruses like SARS-CoV-2 without requiring prior knowledge of 'cryptic'.

3. Written within 18 words, which meets the constraint of being under 20 words long.</a></h3><br>

            <p>['Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 provides early warnings of emerging variants of concerns and can be used to screen for novel cryptic linked-read mutations, which are co-occurring single nucleotide mutations that are rare, or entirely missing, in existing SARS-CoV-2 databases. While previous approaches have focused on specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, there is a need for computational tools capable of efficiently tracking cryptic mutations across the entire genome and investigating their potential origin. We present Crykey, a tool for rapidly identifying rare linked-read mutations across the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the utility of Crykey on over 3,000 wastewater and over 22,000 clinical samples; our findings are three-fold: i) we identify hundreds of cryptic mutations that cover the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, ii) we track the presence of these cryptic mutations across multiple wastewater treatment plants and over three years of sampling in Houston, and iii) we find a handful of cryptic mutations in wastewater mirror cryptic mutations in clinical samples and investigate their potential to represent real cryptic lineages. In summary, Crykey enables large-scale detection of cryptic mutations in wastewater that represent potential circulating cryptic lineages, serving as a new computational tool for wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.']</p>

            <p>['This was the first longitudinal study to analyze dental clinic wastewater to estimate asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection trends in children. We monitored wastewater over a 14-month period, spanning three major COVID-19 waves driven by the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. Each Saturday, wastewater was sampled at the Pediatric Dental Clinic of the only dental hospital in Japan‚Äôs Saitama Prefecture. The relationship between the weekly number of cases in Saitama Prefecture among residents aged\u2009<\u200910\xa0years (exposure) and wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (outcome) was examined. The number of cases was significantly associated with wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity (risk ratio, 5.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.72‚Äì16.67; Fisher‚Äôs exact test,p=\u20090.0005). A sample from Week 8 of 2022 harbored the Omicron variant. Compared to sporadic individual testing, this approach allows continuous population-level surveillance, which is less affected by healthcare seeking and test availability. Since wastewater from pediatric dental clinics originates from the oral cavities of asymptomatic children, such testing can provide important information regarding asymptomatic COVID-19 in children, complementing clinical pediatric data.']</p>

            <p>['Patients on hemodialysis (HD) have a high risk of death from COVID-19. We evaluated the humoral and cell-mediated immune response to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in HD patients, comparing HD with Poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and HD with Polysulphone (PS). Samples were collected before vaccination (T0) and 14-days after the 2ndvaccine (T2) in a TG (TG, n\u2009=\u200916-Foggia) and in a VG (CG, n\u2009=\u200936-Novara). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Ig were titrated in the cohort 2-weeks after the 2nddose of vaccine. In the Testing-Group, serum neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assayed and PBMCs isolated from patients were thawed, counted and stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 IGRA stimulation tube set. All patients had a positive ab-response, except in a case. PMMA-patients had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (p=\u20090.031); VG data confirmed these findings (p<\u20090.05). NAb evaluation: PMMA patients passed the positive cut-off value, while in PS group only only 1/8 patient did not respond. PMMA patients showed higher percentages of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD-Ig after a complete vaccine schedule (p=\u20090.028). Interferon-gamma release: PMMA patients showed significantly higher release of IFNŒ≥ (p=\u20090.014). The full vaccination course provided sufficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 across the entire cohort, regardless of dialyzer type. After vaccination, PMMA patients show a better immune response, both humoral and cellular, at the end of the vaccination course than PS patients.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Healthy individuals with hybrid immunity, due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to first vaccination, have stronger immune responses compared to those who were exclusively vaccinated. However, little is known about the characteristics of antibody, B- and T-cell responses in kidney disease patients with hybrid immunity. Here, we explored differences between kidney disease patients and controls with hybrid immunity after asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We studied the kinetics, magnitude, breadth and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses against primary mRNA-1273 vaccination in patients with chronic kidney disease or on dialysis, kidney transplant recipients, and controls with hybrid immunity. Although vaccination alone is less immunogenic in kidney disease patients, mRNA-1273 induced a robust immune response in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, kidney disease patients with hybrid immunity develop SARS-CoV-2 antibody, B- and T-cell responses that are equally strong or stronger than controls. Phenotypic analysis showed that Spike (S)-specific B-cells varied between groups in lymph node-homing and memory phenotypes, yet S-specific T-cell responses were phenotypically consistent across groups. The heterogeneity amongst immune responses in hybrid immune kidney patients warrants further studies in larger cohorts to unravel markers of long-term protection that can be used for the design of targeted vaccine regimens.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Although the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has improved the mortality rate in the general population, its efficacy against rapidly mutating virus strains, especially in kidney transplant recipients, remains unclear. We examined the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody titers and cellular immunity against B.1.1, BA.1, and BA.5 antigens in 73 uninfected kidney recipients and 16 uninfected healthy controls who received three doses of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The IgG antibody titers were significantly lower in recipients than in healthy controls. Similarly, neutralizing antibody titers against three viral variants were significantly lower in recipients. When the virus was mutated, the neutralizing antibody titers decreased significantly in both groups. In cellular immunity analysis, the number of spike-specific CD8\u2009+\u2009non-na√Øve T cells against three variants significantly decreased in recipients. Conversely, the frequency of spike-specific Th2 CD4\u2009+\u2009T-cells in recipients was higher than that in healthy controls. Nineteen recipients and six healthy controls also received a bivalent omicron-containing booster vaccine, leading to increase IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in both groups. After that, eleven recipients and five healthy controls received XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines, increasing the neutralizing antibody titers against not only XBB.1.5, but also EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 antigens in kidney recipients. Although kidney recipients did not gain sufficient immunity against Omicron BA.5 with the third dose of vaccine, humoral response against mutant SARS-CoV-2 lineages significantly increased after bivalent Omicron-containing booster vaccine and the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine. Therefore, it is important for kidney recipients to continue to administer updated vaccines.']</p>

            <p>The study suggests that high levels of triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol are linked to higher mortality from SARS-CoV-2, emphasizing the need for lipid profiles in predicting COVID-19 severity among Mexican patients.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) removes cholesterol, an essential component in lipid rafts, and this cholesterol removal can regulate protein attachment to lipid rafts, modulating their functionality in the immune cell response. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can alter the lipid profile, there is little information on the role of HDL-c and other lipids in prognostic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Mexican population. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of HDL-c and lipid profile on severity and survival of 102 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 first wave. Our findings, derived from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models, highlighted age and hypertension as significant predictors of survival (HR\u2009=\u20091.04, p\u2009=\u20090.012; HR\u2009=\u20092.78, p\u2009=\u20090.027), while gender, diabetes, and obesity showed no significant impact. Triglycerides and HDL-c levels notably influenced mortality, with elevated triglycerides and lower HDL-c associated with higher mortality risk (p\u2009=\u20090.032). This study underscores the importance of lipid profiles alongside traditional risk factors in assessing COVID-19 risk and outcomes. It contributes to the understanding of COVID-19 patient management and emphasizes the need for further investigation into the role of dyslipidemia in influencing COVID-19 prognosis, potentially aiding in refined risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.']</p>

We used a Korean nationwide claim-based cohort (K-COV-N;n=\u20092,312,748; main cohort) and a Japanese claim-based cohort (JMDC;n=\u20093,115,606; replication cohort) after multi-to-one propensity score matching. Among 2,312,748 Korean participants (mean age, 47.2\u2009years [SD, 15.6]; 1,109,708 [48.0%] female), 17.1% (394,598/2,312,748) were infected with SARS-CoV-2.

We identified COVID-19 vaccination as an attenuating factor, showing a protective association against acute or post-acute respiratory conditions. Furthermore, while the excess post-acute risk diminished with time following SARS-CoV-2 infection, it persisted beyond 6\u2009months post-infection.

            <p>['The immune effector mechanisms involved in protecting against severe COVID-19 infection in elderly nursing home residents following vaccination or natural infection are not well understood. Here, we measured SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-directed functional antibody responses, including neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) and antibody Fc-mediated NK cell activity (degranulation and IFNŒ≥ production), against the Wuhan-Hu-1, BA.4/5 (for NtAb), and Omicron XBB.1.5 variants in elderly nursing home residents (n\u2009=\u200939; median age, 91\xa0years) before and following a third (pre- and post-3D) and a fourth (pre- and post-4D) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Both 3D and 4D boosted NtAb levels against both (sub)variants. Likewise, 3D and 4D increased the ability of sera to trigger both LAMP1- and IFNŒ≥-producing NK cells, in particular against XBB.1.5. In contrast to NtAb titres, the frequencies of LAMP1- and IFNŒ≥-producing NK cells activated by antibodies binding to Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron XBB.1.5 S were comparable at all testing times. Stronger functional antibody responses were observed in vaccine-experienced participants compared to vaccine-na√Øve at some testing times. These findings can contribute to identifying a reliable correlate of protection in elderly nursing home residents against severe COVID-19 and inform future vaccine strategies in this population group.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The rapid development and deployment of vaccines following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been estimated to have saved millions of lives. Despite their immense success, there remains a need for next-generation vaccination approaches for SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses. Here we utilized a Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) vectored vaccine expressing the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a pre-fusion stabilized chimeric conformation (NDV-PFS). When delivered intranasally, NDV-PFS protected both Syrian hamsters and K18 mice against Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Additionally, intranasal vaccination induced robust, durable protection that was extended to 6 months post-vaccination. Overall, our data provide evidence that NDV-vectored vaccines represent a viable next-generation mucosal vaccination approach.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['COVID-19 vaccinations protect against severe illness and death, but associations with post-COVID conditions (PCC) are less clear. We aimed to evaluate the association between prior COVID-19 vaccination and new-onset PCC among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection across eight large healthcare systems in the United States. This retrospective matched cohort study used electronic health records (EHR) from patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive tests during March 2021-February 2022. Vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 cases were matched on location, test date, severity of acute infection, age, and sex. Vaccination status was ascertained using EHR and integrated data on externally administered vaccines. Adjusted relative risks (RRs) were obtained from Poisson regression. PCC was defined as a new diagnosis in one of 13 PCC categories 30 days to 6 months following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The study included 161,531 vaccinated COVID-19 cases and 161,531 matched unvaccinated cases. Compared to unvaccinated cases, vaccinated cases had a similar or lower risk of all PCC categories except mental health disorders (RR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02‚Äì1.10). Vaccination was associated with ‚â•10% lower risk of sensory (RR: 0.90, 0.86‚Äì0.95), circulatory (RR: 0.88, 0.83‚Äì0.94), blood and hematologic (RR: 0.79, 0.71‚Äì0.89), skin and subcutaneous (RR: 0.69, 0.66‚Äì0.72), and non-specific COVID-19 related disorders (RR: 0.53, 0.51‚Äì0.56). In general, associations were stronger at younger ages but mostly persisted regardless of SARS-CoV-2 variant period, receipt of ‚â•3 vs. 1‚Äì2 vaccine doses, or time since vaccination. Pre-infection vaccination was associated with reduced risk of several PCC outcomes and hence may decrease the long-term consequences of COVID-19.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Vaccine development targeting SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 was of critical importance in reducing COVID-19 severity and mortality. In the U.K. during the initial roll-out most individuals either received two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) or the adenovirus-based vaccine from Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-nCoV-19). There are conflicting data as to the impact of age, sex and body habitus on cellular and humoral responses to vaccination, and most studies in this area have focused on determinants of mRNA vaccine immunogenicity. Here, we studied a cohort of participants in a population-based longitudinal study (COVIDENCE UK) to determine the influence of age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and pre-vaccination anti-Spike (anti-S) antibody status on vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses to two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx-n-CoV-19 vaccination. Younger age and pre-vaccination anti-S seropositivity were both associated with stronger antibody responses to vaccination. BNT162b2 generated higher neutralising and anti-S antibody titres to vaccination than ChAdOx1-nCoV-19, but cellular responses to the two vaccines were no different. Irrespective of vaccine type, increasing age was also associated with decreased frequency of cytokine double-positive CD4+T cells. Increasing BMI was associated with reduced frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific TNF+CD8% T cells for both vaccines. Together, our findings demonstrate that increasing age and BMI are associated with attenuated cellular and humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Whilst both vaccines induced T cell responses, BNT162b2 induced significantly elevated humoral immune response as compared to ChAdOx-n-CoV-19.']</p>

            <p>['SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe pulmonary manifestations, with poorly understood mechanisms and limited treatment options. Hyperferritinemia and disrupted lung iron homeostasis in COVID-19 patients imply that\xa0ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, may occur. Immunostaining and lipidomic analysis in COVID-19 lung autopsies reveal increases in ferroptosis markers, including transferrin receptor 1 and malondialdehyde accumulation in fatal cases. COVID-19 lungs display dysregulation of lipids involved in metabolism and ferroptosis. We find increased ferritin light chain associated with severe COVID-19 lung pathology. Iron overload promotes ferroptosis in both primary cells and cancerous lung epithelial cells. In addition, ferroptosis markers strongly correlate with lung injury severity in a COVID-19 lung disease model using male Syrian hamsters. These results reveal a role for ferroptosis in COVID-19 pulmonary disease; pharmacological ferroptosis inhibition may serve as an adjuvant therapy to prevent lung damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection.']</p>

S-specific antibody titers reduced by\u2009~\u200950% at 1st follow-up visit and continued to decline unless re-stimulated by booster vaccine dose or (re)infection. Individuals infected between follow-up visits showed significantly lower S-antibody titers at preceding visits compared to the uninfected individuals. Pre-enrolment infection between primary vaccination dosing exhibited 60% and 50% protection against reinfection at 5 and 9\xa0months, respectively. mRNA vaccines provided highest odds of protection from (re)infection up to 5\xa0months (Odds Ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.08), however, protection persisted for 9\xa0months in AstraZeneca vaccine recipients (OR\u2009=\u20090.06).

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Waning antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination combined with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage led to reduced vaccine effectiveness. As a countermeasure, bivalent mRNA-based booster vaccines encoding the ancestral spike protein in combination with that of Omicron BA.1 or BA.5 were introduced. Since then, different BA.2-descendent lineages have become dominant, such as XBB.1.5, JN.1, or EG.5.1. Here, we report post-hoc analyses of data from the SWITCH-ON study, assessing how different COVID-19 priming regimens affect the immunogenicity of bivalent booster vaccinations and breakthrough infections (NCT05471440). BA.1 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines boosted neutralizing antibodies and T-cells up to 3 months after boost; however, cross-neutralization of XBB.1.5 was poor. Interestingly, different combinations of prime-boost regimens induced divergent responses: participants primed with Ad26.COV2.S developed lower binding antibody levels after bivalent boost while neutralization and T-cell responses were similar to mRNA-based primed participants. In contrast, the breadth of neutralization was higher in mRNA-primed and bivalent BA.5 boosted participants. Combined, our data further support the current use of monovalent vaccines based on circulating strains when vaccinating risk groups, as recently recommended by the WHO. We emphasize the importance of the continuous assessment of immune responses targeting circulating variants to guide future COVID-19 vaccination policies.']</p>

Here we apply muti-single cell omics to compare the inflammatory process in children with acute respiratory COVID-19 and those presenting with non SARS-CoV-2 infections in children. Here we show that in Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), the natural killer cell and monocyte population demonstrate heightened CD95 (Fas) and Interleuking 18 receptor expression. Additionally, TCR VŒ≤21.3+ CD4+ T-cells exhibit skewed differentiation towards T helper 1, 17 and regulatory T cells, with increased expression of the co-stimulation receptors ICOS, CD28 and interleukin 18 receptor. We observe no functional evidence for NLRP3 inflammasome pathway overactivation, though MIS-C monocytes show elevated active caspase 8. This, coupled with raised IL18 mRNA expression in CD16- NK cells on single cell RNA sequencing analysis, suggests interleukin 18 and CD95 signalling may trigger activation of TCR VŒ≤21.3+ T-cells in MIS-C, driven by increased IL-18 production from activated monocytes and CD16- Natural Killer cells.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['During a SARS-CoV-2 infection, macrophages recognize viral components resulting in cytokine production. While this response fuels virus elimination, overexpression of cytokines can lead to severe COVID-19. Previous studies suggest that the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 can elicit cytokine production via the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B and the toll-like receptors (TLRs). In this study, we found that: (i) S and the S2 subunit induceCXCL10, a chemokine implicated in severe COVID-19, gene expression by human macrophage cells (THP-1); (ii) a glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor attenuates this induction; (iii) S and S2 do not activate NF-Œ∫B but do activate the transcription factor IRF; (iv) S and S2 do not require TLR2 to elicit CXCL10 production or activate IRF; and (v) S and S2 elicit CXCL10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also discovered that the cellular response, or lack thereof, to S and S2 is a function of the recombinant S and S2 used. While such a finding raises the possibility of confounding LPS contamination, we offer evidence that potential contaminating LPS does not underly induced increases in CXCL10. Combined, these results provide insights into the complex immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest possible therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19.']</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>The study found that in Seattle from 2018 to 2 Habitat loss due to deforestation has been a significant problem affecting biodiversity, particularly for species with specialized habitat requirements like epiphytes. How does this process impact the diversity and distribution of epiphytic plant communities?
Answer: The loss of habitat caused by deforestation can greatly impact the diversity and distribution of epiphytic plant communities in several ways:

1. Reduced availability of suitable host trees: Epiphytes depend on host trees for support, nutrients, and access to light. When their habitats are destroyed, there may be fewer available host trees, leading to a decline in epiphytic species diversity and abundance.

2. Fragmented habitats: Deforestation can result in fragmented landscapes, which affects the dispersal and movement of pollinators, seed dispersers, and other organisms essential for maintaining healthy populations of epiphytes. This could lead to isolated pockets of epiphytic plants, reducing genetic diversity within species and limiting their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

3. Altered microclimates: Trees play an important role in regulating the local climate by providing shade, retaining water, and influencing humidity levels. The loss of trees can alter these microclimates, which could negatively impact epiphytic species that are sensitive to changes in light, temperature, or moisture conditions.

4. Increased competition for resources: As deforestation continues, the remaining vegetation may become more densely packed and compete for limited resources such as nutrients, water, and sunlight. This could lead to a shift in community composition, with generalists outcompeting specialized epiphytes.

5. Disruption of mutualistic relationships: Epiphytic plants often engage in symbiotic associations with other organisms (e.g., fungi, bacteria, and animals) that help them obtain nutrients and disperse their seeds. The destruction of host trees may also lead to the loss or decline of these mutualistic partners, which would affect epiphyte survival and distribution.

6. Increased vulnerability to climate change: As habitats are lost due to deforestation, many epiphytic plant species face an increased risk of being unable to adapt to changing environmental conditions caused by global warming. This can result in further population declines or even extinction for some species.

In summary, habitat loss from deforestation has significant consequences on the diversity and distribution of epiphyte communities as it directly affects their ability to survive and reproduce. The long-term impact may include decreased species richness, disrupted interactions between organisms, altered community composition, and increased vulnerability to climate change. Conservation efforts that focus on preserving forest habitats and restoring degraded areas are crucial for maintaining epiphyte diversity and ensuring the continued health of these unique plant communities.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Many studies have used mobile device location data to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, yet relationships between mobility behavior and endemic respiratory pathogens are less understood. We studied the effects of population mobility on the transmission of 17 endemic viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle over a 4-year period, 2018-2022. Before 2020, visits to schools and daycares, within-city mixing, and visitor inflow preceded or coincided with seasonal outbreaks of endemic viruses. Pathogen circulation dropped substantially after the initiation of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in March 2020. During this period, mobility was a positive, leading indicator of transmission of all endemic viruses and lagging and negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 activity. Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when restrictions relaxed but associations weakened in subsequent waves. The rebound of endemic viruses was heterogeneously timed but exhibited stronger, longer-lasting relationships with mobility than SARS-CoV-2. Overall, mobility is most predictive of respiratory virus transmission during periods of dramatic behavioral change and at the beginning of epidemic waves.']</p>

            <p>Glycosylation prevents furin cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, influencing viral infectivity; mutations confer glycosylation resistance or susceptibility, revealing a defense/evolutionary interplay between host and virus.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The multibasic furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of the spike protein is a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 and plays a crucial role in viral infection. However, the mechanism underlying furin activation and its regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we show that GalNAc-T3 and T7 jointly initiate clusteredO-glycosylations in the furin cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which inhibit furin processing, suppress the incorporation of the spike protein into virus-like-particles and affect viral infection. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the assembly of the spike protein into virus-like particles relies on interactions between the furin-cleaved spike protein and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a possible mechanism for furin activation. Interestingly, mutations in the spike protein of the alpha and delta variants of the virus confer resistance against glycosylation by GalNAc-T3 and T7. In the omicron variant, additional mutations reverse this resistance, making the spike protein susceptible to glycosylation in vitro and sensitive to GalNAc-T3 and T7 expression in human lung cells. Our findings highlight the role of glycosylation as a defense mechanism employed by host cells against SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on the evolutionary interplay between the host and the virus.']</p>

A working classification was developed from reported final diagnosis.', 'The systematic review included 18 individual cases. Majority of oral lesions occurred following BNT162b2 vaccination with average age of occurrence at 59.94 years. 67% of the affected individuals were female, with hypertension being the most common comorbidity.', 'Immune-mediated oral events have a propensity of occurrence following COVID-19 vaccination. mRNA-based vaccinations may have an affinity for causing oral adverse effects.

            <p>['Plasma RNAemia, delayed antibody responses and inflammation predict COVID-19 outcomes, but the mechanisms underlying these immunovirological patterns are poorly understood. We profile 782 longitudinal plasma samples from 318 hospitalized patients with\xa0COVID-19. Integrated analysis using k-means reveals four patient clusters in a discovery cohort: mechanically ventilated critically-ill cases are subdivided into good prognosis and high-fatality clusters (reproduced in a validation cohort), while non-critical survivors segregate into high and low early antibody responders. Only the high-fatality cluster is enriched for transcriptomic signatures associated with COVID-19 severity, and each cluster has distinct RBD-specific antibody elicitation kinetics. Both critical and non-critical clusters with delayed antibody responses exhibit sustained IFN signatures, which negatively correlate with contemporaneous RBD-specific IgG levels and absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+T cell frequencies. These data suggest that the ‚ÄúInterferon paradox‚Äù previously described in murine LCMV models is operative in COVID-19, with excessive IFN signaling delaying development of adaptive virus-specific immunity.']</p>

A new mRNA COVID-19 vaccine called ARCT-154 was tested in Vietnam and found to be safe, cause antibodies in most people to form, and strongly protect against severe illness from the virus.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Combination of waning immunity and lower effectiveness against new SARS-CoV-2 variants of approved COVID-19 vaccines necessitates new vaccines. We evaluated two doses, 28 days apart, of ARCT-154, a self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, compared with saline placebo in an integrated phase 1/2/3a/3b controlled, observer-blind trial in Vietnamese adults (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT05012943). Primary safety and reactogenicity outcomes were unsolicited adverse events (AE) 28 days after each dose, solicited local and systemic AE 7 days after each dose, and serious AEs throughout the study. Primary immunogenicity outcome was the immune response as neutralizing antibodies 28 days after the second dose. Efficacy against COVID-19 was assessed as primary and secondary outcomes in phase 3b. ARCT-154 was well tolerated with generally mild‚Äìmoderate transient AEs. Four weeks after the second dose 94.1% (95% CI: 92.1‚Äì95.8) of vaccinees seroconverted for neutralizing antibodies, with a geometric mean-fold rise from baseline of 14.5 (95% CI: 13.6‚Äì15.5). Of 640 cases of confirmed COVID-19 eligible for efficacy analysis most were due to the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Efficacy of ARCT-154 was 56.6% (95% CI: 48.7‚Äì 63.3) against any COVID-19, and 95.3% (80.5‚Äì98.9) against severe COVID-19. ARCT-154 vaccination is well tolerated, immunogenic and efficacious, particularly against severe COVID-19 disease.']</p>

            <p>['The fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is functionally important for membrane fusion during virus entry and is part of a broadly neutralizing epitope. However, sequence determinants at the fusion peptide and its adjacent regions for pathogenicity and antigenicity remain elusive. In this study, we perform a series of deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on an S2 region spanning the fusion peptide of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in different cell lines and in the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies. We identify mutations at residue 813 of the spike protein that reduced TMPRSS2-mediated entry with decreased virulence. In addition, we show that an F823Y mutation, present in bat betacoronavirus HKU9 spike protein, confers resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and also highlight a potential challenge in developing broadly protective S2-based coronavirus vaccines.']</p>
