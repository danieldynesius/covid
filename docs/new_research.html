            <p>This study shows how a virus called SARS-CoV-2 changes mitochondria (powerhouse of cells) and uses cell survival signals to spread in the body, which can be slowed down by a drug named vandetanib.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a ‚Äòhighly transmissible respiratory pathogen, leading to severe multi-organ damage. However, knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular alterations is limited. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV-2 aberrantly elevates mitochondrial bioenergetics and activates the EGFR-mediated cell survival signal cascade during the early stage of viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 causes an increase in mitochondrial transmembrane potential via the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-nucleocapsid cluster, thereby abnormally promoting mitochondrial elongation and the OXPHOS process, followed by enhancing ATP production. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 activates the EGFR signal cascade and subsequently induces mitochondrial EGFR trafficking, contributing to abnormal OXPHOS process and viral propagation. Approved EGFR inhibitors remarkably reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation, among which vandetanib exhibits the highest antiviral efficacy. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with vandetanib decreases SARS-CoV-2-induced EGFR trafficking to the mitochondria and restores SARS-CoV-2-induced aberrant elevation in OXPHOS process and ATP generation, thereby resulting in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Furthermore, oral administration of vandetanib to SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 transgenic mice reduces SARS-CoV-2 propagation in lung tissue and mitigates SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation. Vandetanib also exhibits potent antiviral activity against various SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including alpha, beta, delta and omicron, in in vitro cell culture experiments. Taken together, our findings provide novel insight into SARS-CoV-2-induced alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and EGFR trafficking during the early stage of viral infection and their roles in robust SARS-CoV-2 propagation, suggesting that EGFR is an attractive host target for combating COVID-19.']</p>

            <p>This study found that many pregnant women in Accra have COVID-19 antibodies, which can be passed from mother to baby, and is higher after being vaccinated; it also showed the effectiveness of these antibodies compared to those for malaria.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['We aimed to determine SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity among pregnant women and the transplacental transfer efficiency of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies relative to malaria antibodies among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive mother-cord pairs. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Accra, Ghana, from March to May 2022. Antigen- specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (nucleoprotein and spike-receptor binding domain) and malarial antigens (circumsporozoite protein and merozoite surface protein 3) in maternal and cord plasma were measured by ELISA. Plasma from both vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women were tested for neutralizing antibodies using commercial kit. Of the unvaccinated pregnant women tested, 58.12% at antenatal clinics and 55.56% at the delivery wards were seropositive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and RBD antibodies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cord samples correlated with maternal antibody levels (N antigen rs=\u20090.7155,p<\u20090.001; RBD rs=\u20090.8693,p<\u20090.001). Transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibodies was comparable to circumsporozoite protein antibodies (p=\u20090.9999) but both were higher than transfer rates of merozoite surface protein 3 antibodies (p<\u20090.001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity among pregnant women in Accra is high with a boost of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG in vaccinated women. Transplacental transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and malarial antibodies was efficient, supporting vaccination of mothers as a strategy to protect infants against SARS-CoV-2.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, affects neuronal cells, causing several symptoms such as memory loss, anosmia and brain inflammation. Curcuminoids (Me08 e Me23) and curcumin (CUR) are derived fromCurcuma Longa extract(EXT). Many therapeutic actions have been linked to these compounds, including antiviral action. Given the severe implications of COVID-19, especially within the central nervous system, our study aims to shed light on the therapeutic potential of curcuminoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in neuronal cells. Here, we investigated the effects of CUR, EXT, Me08 and Me23 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y. We observed that Me23 significantly decreased the expression of plasma membrane-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and TMPRSS11D, consequently mitigating the elevated ROS levels induced by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, Me23 exhibited antioxidative properties by increasingNRF2gene expression and restoring NQO1 activity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both Me08 and Me23 effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing ACE2 (SH-ACE2). Additionally, all of these compounds demonstrated the ability to decrease proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and IL-17, while Me08 specifically reduced INF-Œ≥ levels. Our findings suggest that curcuminoid Me23 could serve as a potential agent for mitigating the impact of COVID-19, particularly within the context of central nervous system involvement.']</p>

            <p>This study found that a significant number of patients with flu-like symptoms or severe respiratory issues were also infected by both the flu virus H1N1pdm09 and COVID-19, revealing mutations in these viruses which could potentially help them avoid immune detection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases are more prone to Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, we genetically characterized Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in 633 ILI and SARI cases by rRT-PCR and WGS. ILI and SARI cases showed H1N1pdm09 prevalence of 20.9% and 23.2% respectively. 135 (21.3%) H1N1pdm09 and 23 (3.6%) H3N2 and 5 coinfection (0.78%) of H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed H1N1pdm09 resemblance to clade 6B.1A.5a.2 and their genetic relatedness to InfA/Perth/34/2020, InfA/Victoria/88/2020 and InfA/Victoria/2570/2019. Pan 24 HA and 26 NA nonsynonymous mutations and novel HA (G6D, Y7F, Y78H, P212L, G339R, T508K and S523T) and NA (S229A) mutations were observed. S74R, N129D, N156K, S162N, K163Q and S164T alter HA Cb and Sa antibody recognizing site. Similarly, M19T, V13T substitution and multiple mutations in transmembrane and NA head domain drive antigenic drift. SARS-CoV-2 strains genetically characterized to Omicron BA.2.75 lineage containing thirty nonsynonymous spike mutations exhibited enhanced virulence and transmission rates. Coinfection although detected very minimal, the mutational changes in H1N1pdm09 and SARS-CoV-2 virus infected individuals could alter antibody receptor binding sites, allowing the viruses to escape immune response resulting in better adaptability and transmission. Thus continuous genomic surveillance is required to tackle any future outbreak.']</p>

This revised title simplifies the original while maintaining its core message. The term "lyophilization" has been replaced with "quick," which broadens to encompass both lyophilization and speed aspects of the protocol development, and "colorimetric RT-LAMP diagnostic assay for COVID-19" has been shortened to "Colorful Test Procedure for COVID-19 Detection." This change retains the essence of a developed testing method that is easy to understand.</a></h3><br>

            <p>This research creates stable room-temperature transport-ready molecular test kits for detecting coronavirus using a modified colorimetric RT-LAMP method with good sensitivity and specificity results.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Molecular diagnostics involving nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are regarded as extremely functional tools. During the 2020 global health crisis, efforts intensified to optimize the production and delivery of molecular diagnostic kits for detecting SARS-CoV-2. During this period, RT-LAMP emerged as a significant focus. However, the thermolability of the reagents used in this technique necessitates special low-temperature infrastructure for transport, storage, and conservation. These requirements limit distribution capacity and necessitate cost-increasing adaptations. Consequently, this report details the development of a lyophilization protocol for reagents in a colorimetric RT-LAMP diagnostic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2, facilitating room-temperature transport and storage. We conducted tests to identify the ideal excipients that maintain the molecular integrity of the reagents and ensure their stability during room-temperature storage and transport. The optimal condition identified involved adding 5% PEG 8000 and 75\xa0mM trehalose to the RT-LAMP reaction, which enabled stability at room temperature for up to 28\xa0days and yielded an analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 83.33% and 90%, respectively, for detecting SARS-CoV-2. This study presents the results of a lyophilized colorimetric RT-LAMP COVID-19 detection assay with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity comparable to RT-qPCR, particularly in samples with high viral load.']</p>

            <p>SARS-CoV-2's main protein is sensitive to oxygen levels, with a disulfide bond between key sites potentially preventing permanent damage and affecting its ability to form crystals under oxidized states.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for viral function and a key drug target. Mprois only active when reduced; turnover ceases upon oxidation but is restored by re-reduction. This suggests the system has evolved to survive periods in an oxidative environment, but the mechanism of this protection has not been confirmed. Here, we report a crystal structure of oxidized Mproshowing a disulfide bond between the active site cysteine, C145, and a distal cysteine, C117. Previous work proposed this disulfide provides the mechanism of protection from irreversible oxidation. Mproforms an obligate homodimer, and the C117-C145 structure shows disruption of interactions bridging the dimer interface, implying a correlation between oxidation and dimerization. We confirm dimer stability is weakened in solution upon oxidation. Finally, we observe the protein‚Äôs crystallization behavior is linked to its redox state. Oxidized Mprospontaneously forms a distinct, more loosely packed lattice. Seeding with crystals of this lattice yields a structure with an oxidation pattern incorporating one cysteine-lysine-cysteine (SONOS) and two lysine-cysteine (NOS) bridges. These structures further our understanding of the oxidative regulation of Mproand the crystallization conditions necessary to study this structurally.']</p>

            <p>['Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in African countries with high levels of infection-driven immunity and low vaccine coverage. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 349 participants from 52 households in The Gambia between March 2021 and June 2022, with routine weekly SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 6-monthly SARS-CoV-2 serology. Attack rates of 45% and 57% were seen during Delta and Omicron BA.1 waves respectively. Eighty-four percent of RT-PCR-positive infections were asymptomatic. Children under 5-years had a lower incidence of infection than 18-49-year-olds. One prior SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced infection risk during the Delta wave only, with immunity from ‚â•2 prior infections required to reduce the risk of infection with early Omicron lineage viruses. In an African population with high levels of infection-driven immunity and low vaccine coverage, we find high attack rates during SARS-CoV-2 waves, with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections and young children remaining relatively protected from infection.']</p>

            <p>['The present work elicits a novel approach to combating COVID-19 by synthesizing a series of azo-anchored 3,4-dihydroimidazo[4,5-b]indole derivatives. The envisaged methodology involves thel-proline-catalyzed condensation ofpara-amino-functionalized azo benzene, indoline-2,3-dione, and ammonium acetate precursors with pertinent aryl aldehyde derivatives under ultrasonic conditions. The structures of synthesized compounds were corroborated through FT-IR,1H NMR,13C NMR, and mass analysis data. Molecular docking studies assessed the inhibitory potential of these compounds against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, in silico investigations revealed significant inhibitory action surpassing standard drugs such as Remdesivir, Paxlovid, Molnupiravir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and (N3), an irreversible Michael acceptor inhibitor. Furthermore, the highly active compound was also screened for cytotoxicity activity against HEK-293 cells and exhibited minimal toxicity across a range of concentrations, affirming its favorable safety profile and potential suitability. The pharmacokinetic properties (ADME) of the synthesized compounds have also been deliberated. This study paves the way for in vitro and in vivo testing of these scaffolds in the ongoing battle against SARS-CoV-2.']</p>

            <p>['The ideal vaccines for combating diseases that may emerge in the future require more than simply inactivating a few pathogenic strains. This study aims to provide a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine effective against various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strains. To design the vaccine, a library of peptides from the spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope structural proteins of various strains was prepared. Then, the final vaccine structure was optimized using the fully protected epitopes and the fynomer scaffold. Using bioinformatics tools, the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties, population coverage, and secondary and three-dimensional structures of the vaccine candidate were evaluated. The bioinformatic analyses confirmed the high quality of the vaccine. According to further investigations, this structure is similar to native protein and there is a stable and strong interaction between vaccine and receptors. Based on molecular dynamics simulation, structural compactness and stability in binding were also observed. In addition, the immune simulation showed that the vaccine can stimulate immune responses similar to real conditions. Finally, codon optimization and in silico cloning confirmed efficient expression inEscherichia coli. In conclusion, the fynomer-based vaccine can be considered as a new style in designing and updating vaccines to protect against coronavirus disease.']</p>

            <p>['Whole virus-based inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide have been critical to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Although these vaccines are protective against homologous coronavirus infection, the emergence of novel variants and the presence of large zoonotic reservoirs harboring novel heterologous coronaviruses provide significant opportunities for vaccine breakthrough, which raises the risk of adverse outcomes like vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. Here, we use a female mouse model of coronavirus disease to evaluate inactivated vaccine performance against either homologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 or heterologous challenge with a bat-derived coronavirus that represents a potential emerging disease threat. We show that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide can cause enhanced respiratory disease during heterologous infection, while use of an alternative adjuvant does not drive disease and promotes heterologous viral clearance. In this work, we highlight the impact of adjuvant selection on inactivated vaccine safety and efficacy against heterologous coronavirus infection.']</p>

We serially measured binding and neutralizing antibody titers (nAbs), spike-specific memory B cell (MBC) and spike-reactive T cell responses over 1 year. We found that children mounted antibody, MBC and T cell responses after two doses of BNT162b2, with higher antibody and T cell responses than adults 6 months after vaccination. A booster (third) dose only improved antibody titers without impacting MBC and T cell responses. Among children with hybrid immunity, nAbs and T cell responses were highest in those infected after two vaccine doses. Binding IgG titers, MBC and T cell responses were predictive, with T cells being the most important predictor of protection against symptomatic infection before hybrid immunity; nAbs only correlated with protection after hybrid immunity. The stable MBC and T cell responses over time suggest sustained protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, even when nAbs wane.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Our previous study in children and young people (CYP) at 3- and 6-months post-infection showed that 12‚Äì16% of those infected with the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 met the research definition of Long Covid, with no differences between first-positive and reinfected CYP. The primary objective of the current study is to explore the impact of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection on young people 12 months post infection. 345 CYP aged 11‚Äì17\xa0years with a first laboratory-confirmed infection with the Omicron variant and 360 CYP reinfected with the Omicron variant completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, symptoms, and their impact shortly after testing and again at 3-, 6-and 12-months post-testing. Vaccination status was determined from information held at UKHSA. Comparisons between groups were made using chi-squared, Mann‚ÄìWhitney U, and Kruskal‚ÄìWallis tests. The most common symptoms in first-positive and reinfected CYP 12-months post-testing were tiredness (35.7 and 33.6% respectively) and sleeping difficulties (27.5 and 28.3% respectively). Symptom profiles, severity and impact were similar in the two infection status groups. Overall, by 12-months, 17.4% of first-positives and 21.9% of reinfected CYP fulfilled the research consensus Long Covid definition (p=\u20090.13). 12-months post Omicron infection, there is little difference between first-positive and reinfected CYP with respect to symptom profiles and impact. Clinicians may not therefore need to consider number of infections and type of variant when developing treatment plans. Further studies are needed to assess causality of reported symptoms up to 12-months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or the continuation of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) symptoms past 12\xa0weeks may affect as many as 30% of people recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) infection. The mechanisms regulating the development of PASC are currently not known; however, hypotheses include virus reservoirs, pre-existing conditions, microblood clots, immune dysregulation, as well as poor antibody responses. Importantly, virus neutralizing antibodies are essential for COVID-19 recovery and protection from reinfection but there is currently limited information on these immune regulators and associated cytokines in PASC patients. Understanding the key drivers of general and specific symptoms associated with Long COVID and the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies in PASC will aid in the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines which currently do not exist. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate systemic antibody and cytokine responses during COVID-19 recovery and PASC. In total, 195 participants were recruited in one of four groups: (1) Those who never had COVID-19 (No COVID); (2) Those in acute COVID-19 recovery (Acute Recovery) (4‚Äì12\xa0weeks post infection); (3) Those who recovered from COVID-19 (Recovered) (+\u200912\xa0weeks from infection); and (4) those who had PASC (PASC) (+\u200912\xa0weeks from infection). Participants completed a questionnaire on health history, sex, gender, demographics, experiences with COVID-19 acute and COVID-19 recovery/continuing symptoms. Serum samples collected were evaluated for antibody binding to viral proteins, virus neutralizing antibody titers, and serum cytokine levels using Ella SimplePlex Immunoassay‚Ñ¢ panels. We found participants with PASC reported more pre-existing conditions (e.g. such as hypertension, asthma, and obesity), and PASC symptoms (e.g. fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and shortness of breath) following COVID-19 than COVID-19 Recovered individuals. Importantly, we found PASC individuals to have significantly decreased levels of neutralizing antibodies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.1 variant. Sex analysis indicated that female PASC study participants had sustained antibody levels as well as levels of the inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF and ANG-2 over time following COVID-19. Our study reports people experiencing PASC had lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies; however, the results are limited by the collection time post-COVID-19 and post-vaccination. Moreover, we found females experiencing PASC had sustained levels of GM-CSF and ANG-2. With lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, this data suggests that PASC individuals not only have had a suboptimal antibody response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but may also have increased susceptibility to subsequent infections which may exacerbate or prolong current PASC illnesses. We also provide evidence suggesting GM-CSF and ANG-2 to play a role in the sex-bias of PASC. Taken together, our findings maybe important for understanding immune molecular drivers of PASC and PASC subgroups.']</p>

            <p>The study found that a new COVID-1 cvirus vaccine, S-268019-b, produced stronger immune responses compared to the existing ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in Japan.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['We assessed S-268019-b, a recombinant spike protein vaccine with a squalene-based adjuvant, for superiority in its immunogenicity over\xa0ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among adults in Japan. In this multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, phase 3 study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)‚Äìna√Øve participants (aged\u2009‚â•\u200918\xa0years, without prior infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2) were randomized (1:1) to receive either S-268019-b or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 as two intramuscular injections given 28\xa0days apart. Participants who provided consent for a booster administration received S-268019-b at Day 211. The primary endpoint was SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer on Day 57; the key secondary endpoint was the seroconversion rate for SARS-CoV-2 NAb titer on Day 57. Other endpoints included anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 S-protein immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody titer and safety. The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between S-268019-b (n\u2009=\u2009611) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n\u2009=\u2009610) groups. S-268019-b showed superior immunogenicity over ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, based on their geometric mean titers (GMTs) and GMT ratios of SARS-CoV-2 NAb on Day 57 by cytopathic effect assay (GMT [95% confidence interval {CI}] 19.92 [18.68, 21.23] versus 3.63 [3.41, 3.87]; GMT ratio [95% CI] 5.48 [5.01, 6.00], respectively; two-sidedp-values\u2009<\u20090.0001). Additionally, NAb measured using a cell viability assay also showed similar results (GMT [95% CI] 183.25 [168.04, 199.84] versus 24.79 [22.77, 27.00]; GMT ratio [95% CI] 7.39 [6.55, 8.35] for S-268019-b versus ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, respectively;p<\u20090.0001). The GMT of anti‚ÄìSARS-CoV-2 S-protein IgG antibody was 370.05 for S-268019-b versus 77.92 for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on Day 57 (GMT ratio [95% CI] 4.75 [4.34, 5.20]). Notably, immune responses were durable through the end of the study. S-268019-b elicited T-helper 1 skewed T-cell response, comparable to that of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. After the first dose, the incidence of solicited systemic treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was higher in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, but after the second dose, the incidence was higher in the S-268019-b group. Headache, fatigue, and myalgia were the most commonly reported solicited systemic TRAEs, while pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local TRAE following both doses in both groups. No serious treatment-related adverse serious TRAEs events were reported in the two groups. S-268019-b was more immunogenic than ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and was well tolerated (jRCT2051210151).']</p>

            <p>This study identifies new derivatives of andrographolide that could potentially inhibit key SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but further tests are needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The Covid-19 pandemic outbreak has accelerated tremendous efforts to discover a therapeutic strategy that targets severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control viral infection. Various viral proteins have been identified as potential drug targets, however, to date, no specific therapeutic cure is available against the SARS-CoV-2. To address this issue, the present work reports a systematic cheminformatic approach to identify the potent andrographolide derivatives that can target methyltransferases of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. nsp14 and nsp16 which are crucial for the replication of the virus and host immune evasion. A consensus of cheminformatics methodologies including virtual screening, molecular docking, ADMET profiling, molecular dynamics simulations, free-energy landscape analysis, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA), and density functional theory (DFT) was utilized. Our study reveals two new andrographolide derivatives (PubChem CID: 2734589 and 138968421) as natural bioactive molecules that can form stable complexes with both proteins via hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The toxicity analysis predicts class four toxicity for both compounds with LD50value in the range of 500‚Äì700\xa0mg/kg. MD simulation reveals the stable formation of the complex for both the compounds and their average trajectory values were found to be lower than the control inhibitor and protein alone. MMGBSA analysis corroborates the MD simulation result and showed the lowest energy for the compounds 2734589 and 138968421. The DFT and MEP analysis also predicts the better reactivity and stability of both the hit compounds. Overall, both andrographolide derivatives exhibit good potential as potent inhibitors for both nsp14 and nsp16 proteins, however, in-vitro and in vivo assessment would be required to prove their efficacy and safety in clinical settings. Moreover, the drug discovery strategy aiming at the dual target approach might serve as a useful model for inventing novel drug molecules for various other diseases.']</p>

            <p>An immunosuppressed COVID-1ayer had persistent Omicron infections, with RDV resistance caused by C799F nsp12 mutation leading to diverse resistant viral strains.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variant strains with altered characteristics have emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir (RDV), a ribonucleotide analogue inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase, has become a valuable therapeutic agent. However, immunosuppressed hosts may respond inadequately to RDV and develop chronic persistent infections. A patient with respiratory failure caused by interstitial pneumonia, who had undergone transplantation of the left lung, developed COVID-19 caused by Omicron BA.5 strain with persistent chronic viral shedding, showing viral fusogenicity. Genome-wide sequencing analyses revealed the occurrence of several viral mutations after RDV treatment, followed by dynamic changes in the viral populations. The C799F mutation in nsp12 was found to play a pivotal role in conferring RDV resistance, preventing RDV-triphosphate from entering the active site of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The occurrence of diverse mutations is a characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, which mutates frequently. Herein, we describe the clinical case of an immunosuppressed host in whom inadequate treatment resulted in highly diverse SARS-CoV-2 mutations that threatened the patient‚Äôs health due to the development of drug-resistant variants.']</p>

            <p>This study shows that higher levels of a protein called pNfL are found in patients with lingering brain-related issues after COVID-1ran, potentially indicating CNS involvement and helping pinpoint those needing ongoing care.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['It is well known the potential of severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to induce post-acute sequelae, a condition called Long COVID. This syndrome includes several symptoms, but the central nervous system (CNS) main one is neurocognitive dysfunction. Recently it has been demonstrated the relevance of plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (pNfL), as a biomarker of early involvement of the CNS in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pNfL in patients with post-acute neurocognitive symptoms and the potential of NfL as a prognostic biomarker in these cases. A group of 63 long COVID patients ranging from 18 to 59 years-old were evaluated, submitted to a neurocognitive battery assessment, and subdivided in different groups, according to results. Plasma samples were collected during the long COVID assessment and used for measurement of pNfL with the Single molecule array (SIMOA) assays. Levels of pNfL were significantly higher in long COVID patients with neurocognitive symptoms when compared to HC (p=\u20090.0031). Long COVID patients with cognitive impairment and fatigue symptoms presented higher pNfL levels when compared to long COVID patients without these symptoms, individually and combined (p=\u20090.0263,p=\u20090.0480, and 0.0142, respectively). Correlation analysis showed that levels of cognitive lost and exacerbation of fatigue in the neurocognitive evaluation had a significative correlation with higher pNfL levels (p=\u20090.0219 and 0.0255, respectively). Previous reports suggested that pNfL levels are related with higher risk of severity and predict lethality of COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a long-term impact on the brain, even in patients who presented mild acute disease. NfL measurements might be useful to identify CNS involvement in long COVID associated with neurocognitive symptoms and to identify who will need continuous monitoring and treatment support.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Developing a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for combatting the epidemic. Here, we investigated long-term immune responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 for the intranasal vaccination of a triple receptor-binding domain (RBD) scaffold protein (3R-NC) adjuvanted with a flagellin protein (KFD) (3R-NC+KFDi.n). In mice, the vaccination elicited RBD-specific broad-neutralizing antibody responses in both serum and mucosal sites sustained at high level over a year. This long-lasting humoral immunity was correlated with the presence of long-lived RBD-specific IgG- and IgA-producing plasma cells, alongside the Th17 and Tfh17-biased T-cell responses driven by the KFD adjuvant. Based upon these preclinical findings, an open labeled clinical trial was conducted in individuals who had been primed with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (IAV) vaccine. With a favorable safety profile, the3R-NC+KFDi.nboost elicited enduring broad-neutralizing IgG in plasma and IgA in salivary secretions. To meet the challenge of frequently emerged variants, we further designed an updated triple-RBD scaffold protein with mutated RBD combinations, which can induce adaptable antibody responses to neutralize the newly emerging variants, including JN.1. Our findings highlight the potential of the KFD-adjuvanted triple-RBD scaffold protein is a promising prototype for the development of a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing outbreak, disrupting human life worldwide. Vaccine development was prioritized to obtain a biological substance for combating the viral pathogen and lessening disease severity. In vaccine production, biological origin and relevant materials must be carefully examined for potential contaminants in conformity with good manufacturing practice. Due to fast mutation, several SARS-CoV-2 variants and sublineages have been identified. Currently, most of COVID-19 vaccines are developed based on the protein sequence of the Wuhan wild type strain. New vaccines specific for emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously needed to tackle the incessant evolution of the virus. Therefore, in vaccine development and production, a reliable method to identify the nature of subunit vaccines is required to avoid cross-contamination. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using quadrupole-time of flight along with tryptic digestion was developed for distinguishing protein materials derived from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. After analyzing the recombinantly produced receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nine characteristic peptides were identified with acceptable limits of detection. They can be used together to distinguish 14 SARS-CoV-2 strains, except Kappa and Epsilon. Plant-produced RBD-Fc protein derived from Omicron strains can be easily distinguished from the others with 4‚Äì5 unique peptides. Eventually, a peptide key was developed based on the nine peptides, offering a prompt and precise flowchart to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 strain identification in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing.']</p>

            <p>['Immunization via the respiratory route is predicted to increase the effectiveness of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of one or two doses of a live-attenuated murine pneumonia virus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike protein (MPV/S-2P), delivered intranasally/intratracheally to male rhesus macaques. A single dose of MPV/S-2P is highly immunogenic, and a second dose increases the magnitude and breadth of the mucosal and systemic anti-S antibody responses and increases levels of dimeric anti-S IgA in the airways. MPV/S-2P also induces S-specific CD4+and CD8+T-cells in the airways that differentiate into large populations of tissue-resident memory cells within a month after the boost. One dose induces substantial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and two doses of MPV/S-2P are fully protective against SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus replication in the airways. A prime/boost immunization with a mucosally-administered live-attenuated MPV vector could thus be highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.']</p>

            <p>['An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (1 March\xa0to\xa010 May 2021) with an attack rate of 26.5% among approximately 1150 workers at a storage and distribution centre in England prompted a multidisciplinary outbreak investigation (5 May\xa0to\xa06 August 2021), with the aim of better understanding worker- and workplace-related risk factors for viral transmission in the warehousing sector. Overall, environmental factors (e.g., ventilation, humidity and temperature) were assessed to be appropriate at the facility. Nevertheless, 39 (51.3%) surface samples from across the site tested positive for low/ very low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct value\u2009‚â•\u200932.0 for all). Among the study participants, of whom 35.6% were confirmed or suspected cases, 95.5% reported having received COVID-19 prevention training, 100.0% reported handwashing, and 80.0% reported use of face coverings at work. Notably, 43.9% and 19.0% reported working with a symptomatic and a positive contact respectively. Furthermore, 80.5% and 46.3% had concerns regarding reduction in their income and future unemployment, respectively, due to self-isolation. The findings of this study suggest that, in addition to targeted workplace infection control measures and tailored work area specific risk assessments, an enhanced and equitable sick leave policy may help limit presenteeism and viral transmission in large workplaces.']</p>

I have condensed the title while maintaining its core message. The term "aerostability" has been simplified to "airborne," which is more commonly understood, and "infection risk" was kept as it effectively conveys the potential danger of transmission. This revised title stays within a 20-word limit and uses straightforward language suitable for general audiences.</a></h3><br>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['An improved understanding of the underlying physicochemical properties of respiratory aerosol that influence viral infectivity may open new avenues to mitigate the transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that an increase in the pH of respiratory aerosols following generation due to changes in the gas-particle partitioning of pH buffering bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide is a significant factor in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We show here that a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 aerostability results from a moderate increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (e.g. 800 ppm), an effect that is more marked than that observed for changes in relative humidity. We model the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission on the ambient concentration of CO2, concluding that even this moderate increase in CO2concentration results in a significant increase in overall risk. These observations confirm the critical importance of ventilation and maintaining low CO2concentrations in indoor environments for mitigating disease transmission. Moreover, the correlation of increased CO2concentration with viral aerostability need to be better understood when considering the consequences of increases in ambient CO2levels in our atmosphere.']</p>

            <p>SARS-CoV-2 triggers lung inflammation by activating macrophages' inflammasomes, leading to IL-1 release and cell death, while endothelial cells contribute to excessive immune response through IL-1Œ± secretion without infection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Inflammasome assembly is a potent mechanism responsible for the host protection against pathogens, including viruses. When compromised, it can allow viral replication, while when disrupted, it can perpetuate pathological responses by IL-1 signaling and pyroptotic cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to activate inflammasome in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, however, potential mechanisms responsible for this response are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of ORF3a, E and M SARS-CoV-2 viroporins in the inflammasome activation in major populations of alveolar sentinel cells: macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells. We demonstrated that each viroporin is capable of activation of the inflammasome in macrophages to trigger pyroptosis-like cell death and IL-1Œ±release from epithelial and endothelial cells. Small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors reduced IL-1 release but weakly affected the pyroptosis. Importantly, we discovered that while SARS-CoV-2 could not infect the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells it induced IL-1Œ±and IL-33 release. Together, these findings highlight the essential role of macrophages as the major inflammasome-activating cell population in the lungs and point to endothelial cell expressed IL-1Œ±as a potential novel component driving the pulmonary immunothromobosis in COVID-19.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The individual results of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests measured after the first pandemic wave of 2020 cannot be directly interpreted as a probability of having been infected. Plus, these results are usually returned as a binary or ternary variable, relying on predefined cut-offs. We propose a Bayesian mixture model to estimate individual infection probabilities, based on 81,797 continuous anti-spike IgG tests from Euroimmun collected in France after the first wave. This approach used serological results as a continuous variable, and was therefore not based on diagnostic cut-offs. Cumulative incidence, which is necessary to compute infection probabilities, was estimated according to age and administrative region. In France, we found that a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù or a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù test, as classified by the manufacturer, could correspond to a probability of infection as high as 61.8% or as low as 67.7%, respectively. ‚ÄúIndeterminate‚Äù tests encompassed probabilities of infection ranging from 10.8 to 96.6%. Our model estimated tailored individual probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on age, region, and serological result. It can be applied in other contexts, if estimates of cumulative incidence are available.']</p>

            <p>['Under-reporting of COVID-19 and the limited information about circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants remain major challenges for many African countries. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Addis Ababa and Jimma, Ethiopia, focusing on reinfection, immunity, and vaccination effects. We conducted an antibody serology study spanning August 2020 to July 2022 with five rounds of data collection across a population of 4723, sequenced PCR-test positive samples, used available test positivity rates, and constructed two mathematical models integrating this data. A multivariant model explores variant dynamics identifying wildtype, alpha, delta, and omicron BA.4/5 as key variants in the study population, and cross-immunity between variants, revealing risk reductions between 24% and 69%. An antibody-level model predicts slow decay leading to sustained high antibody levels. Retrospectively,\xa0increased early vaccination might have substantially reduced infections during the delta and omicron waves in the considered group of individuals, though further vaccination now seems less impactful.']</p>

            <p>A study found that a growth factor called FGF7 increases ACE2 expression in pancreas cells, making them more susceptible to virus damage and potentially worsening COVID-19 symptoms for diabetics.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a primary cell surface viral binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, so finding new regulatory molecules to modulate ACE2 expression levels is a promising strategy against COVID-19. In the current study, we utilized islet organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), animal models and COVID-19 patients to discover that fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) enhances ACE2 expression within the islets, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulting in impaired insulin secretion. Using hESC-derived islet organoids, we demonstrated that FGF7 interacts with FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) and FGFR1 to upregulate ACE2 expression predominantly in Œ≤ cells. This upregulation increases both insulin secretion and susceptibility of Œ≤ cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhibiting FGFR counteracts the FGF7-induced ACE2 upregulation, subsequently reducing viral infection and replication in the islets. Furthermore, retrospective clinical data revealed that diabetic patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms exhibited elevated serum FGF7 levels compared to those with mild symptoms. Finally, animal experiments indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection increased pancreatic FGF7 levels, resulting in a reduction of insulin concentrations in situ. Taken together, our research offers a potential regulatory strategy for ACE2 by controlling FGF7, thereby protecting islets from SARS-CoV-2 infection and preventing the progression of diabetes in the context of COVID-19.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Nitrosative stress promotes protein glycoxidation, and both processes can occur during an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess selected nitrosative stress parameters and protein glycoxidation products in COVID-19 patients and convalescents relative to healthy subjects, including in reference to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. The diagnostic utility of nitrosative stress and protein glycoxidation biomarkers was also evaluated in COVID-19 patients. The study involved 218 patients with COVID-19, 69 convalescents, and 48 healthy subjects. Nitrosative stress parameters (NO, S-nitrosothiols, nitrotyrosine) and protein glycoxidation products (tryptophan, kynurenine, N-formylkynurenine, dityrosine, AGEs) were measured in the blood plasma or serum with the use of colorimetric/fluorometric methods. The levels of NO (p=\u20090.0480), S-nitrosothiols (p=\u20090.0004), nitrotyrosine (p=\u20090.0175), kynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), N-formylkynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), dityrosine (p<\u20090.0001), and AGEs (p<\u20090.0001) were significantly higher, whereas tryptophan fluorescence was significantly (p<\u20090.0001) lower in COVID-19 patients than in the control group. Significant differences in the analyzed parameters were observed in different stages of COVID-19. In turn, the concentrations of kynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), N-formylkynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), dityrosine (p<\u20090.0001), and AGEs (p<\u20090.0001) were significantly higher, whereas tryptophan levels were significantly (p<\u20090.0001) lower in convalescents than in healthy controls. The ROC analysis revealed that protein glycoxidation products can be useful for diagnosing infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus because they differentiate COVID-19 patients (KN: sensitivity‚Äî91.20%, specificity‚Äî92.00%; NFK: sensitivity‚Äî92.37%, specificity‚Äî92.00%; AGEs: sensitivity‚Äî99,02%, specificity‚Äî100%) and convalescents (KN: sensitivity‚Äî82.22%, specificity‚Äî84.00%; NFK: sensitivity‚Äî82,86%, specificity‚Äî86,00%; DT: sensitivity‚Äî100%, specificity‚Äî100%; AGE: sensitivity‚Äî100%, specificity‚Äî100%) from healthy subjects with high sensitivity and specificity. Nitrosative stress and protein glycoxidation are intensified both during and after an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The levels of redox biomarkers fluctuate in different stages of the disease. Circulating biomarkers of nitrosative stress/protein glycoxidation have potential diagnostic utility in both COVID-19 patients and convalescents.']</p>

            <p>['The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to evade vaccines and therapeutics underlines the need for innovative therapies with high genetic barriers to resistance. Therefore, there is pronounced interest in identifying new pharmacological targets in the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle. The small molecule PAV-104, identified through a cell-free protein synthesis and assembly screen, was recently shown to target host protein assembly machinery in a manner specific to viral assembly. In this study, we investigate the capacity of PAV-104 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway epithelial cells (AECs). We show that PAV-104 inhibits >99% of infection with diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants in immortalized AECs, and in primary human AECs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to represent the lung microenvironment in vivo. Our data demonstrate that PAV-104 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 production without affecting viral entry, mRNA transcription, or protein synthesis. PAV-104 interacts with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and interferes with its oligomerization, blocking particle assembly. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that PAV-104 reverses SARS-CoV-2 induction of the type-I interferon response and the maturation of nucleoprotein signaling pathway known to support coronavirus replication. Our findings suggest that PAV-104 is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 with a mechanism of action that is distinct from existing clinical management approaches.']</p>

We conducted comprehensive analyses detailing immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus in blood post-vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a placebo. Samples from randomised placebo-controlled trials (NCT04324606 and NCT04400838) were taken at baseline, onset of COVID-19-like symptoms, and 7 days later, confirming COVID-19 using nucleic amplification test (NAAT test) via real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Serum cytokines were measured with multiplexed immunoassays. The transcriptome was analysed with long, short and small RNA sequencing. We found attenuation of RNA inflammatory signatures in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 compared with placebo vaccinees and reduced levels of serum proteins associated with COVID-19 severity.KREMEN1, a putative alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor, was downregulated in placebo compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees. Vaccination ameliorates reductions in cell counts across leukocyte populations and platelets noted at COVID-19 onset, without inducing potentially deleterious Th2-skewed immune responses. Multi-omics integration links a global reduction in miRNA expression at COVID-19 onset to increased pro-inflammatory responses at the mRNA level. This study reveals insights into the role of COVID-19 vaccines in mitigating disease severity by abrogating pro-inflammatory responses associated with severe COVID-19, affirming vaccine-mediated benefit in breakthrough infection, and highlighting the importance of clinically relevant endpoints in vaccine evaluation.']</p>

Our findings suggest that SHM accumulation in the BCR space to broaden its specificity for unseen antigens is a counterprotective mechanism against virus variant immune escape.']</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>['Here we conducted a multicenter open-label, randomized phase 2 and 3 study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron-specific (BA.1/B.1.1.529), monovalent, thermostable, self-amplifying mRNA vaccine, GEMCOVAC-OM, when administered intradermally as a booster in healthy adults who had received two doses of BBV152 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. GEMCOVAC-OM was well tolerated with no related serious adverse events in both phase 2 and phase 3. In phase 2, the safety and immunogenicity of GEMCOVAC-OM was compared with our prototype mRNA vaccine GEMCOVAC-19 (D614G variant-specific) in 140 participants. At day 29 after vaccination, there was a significant rise in anti-spike (BA.1) IgG antibodies with GEMCOVAC-OM (P<\u20090.0001) and GEMCOVAC-19 (P<\u20090.0001). However, the IgG titers (primary endpoint) and seroconversion were higher with GEMCOVAC-OM (P<\u20090.0001). In phase 3, GEMCOVAC-OM was compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 3,140 participants (safety cohort), which included an immunogenicity cohort of 420 participants. At day 29, neutralizing antibody titers against the BA.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher than baseline in the GEMCOVAC-OM arm (P<\u20090.0001), but not in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 arm (P=\u20090.1490). GEMCOVAC-OM was noninferior (primary endpoint) and superior to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in terms of neutralizing antibody titers and seroconversion rate (lower bound 95% confidence interval of least square geometric mean ratio >1 and difference in seroconversion >0% for superiority). At day 29, anti-spike IgG antibodies and seroconversion (secondary endpoints) were significantly higher with GEMCOVAC-OM (P<\u20090.0001). These results demonstrate that GEMCOVAC-OM is safe and boosts immune responses against the B.1.1.529 variant. Clinical Trial Registry India identifier:CTRI/2022/10/046475.']</p>

            <p>['Many molecular mechanisms that lead to the host antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines remain largely unknown. In this study, we used serum antibody detection combined with whole blood RNA-based transcriptome analysis to investigate variability in vaccine response in healthy recipients of a booster (third) dose schedule of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine against COVID-19. The cohort was divided into two groups: (1) low-stable individuals, with antibody concentration anti-SARS-CoV IgG S1 below 0.4 percentile at 180\xa0days after boosting vaccination; and (2) high-stable individuals, with antibody values greater than 0.6 percentile of the range in the same period (median 9525 [185‚Äì80,000] AU/mL). Differential gene expression, expressed single nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions, differential splicing events, and allelic imbalance were explored to broaden our understanding of the immune response sustenance. Our analysis revealed a differential expression of genes with immunological functions in individuals with low antibody titers, compared to those with higher antibody titers, underscoring the fundamental importance of the innate immune response for boosting immunity. Our findings also provide new insights into the determinants of the immune response variability to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine booster, highlighting the significance of differential splicing regulatory mechanisms, mainly concerningHLAalleles, in delineating vaccine immunogenicity.']</p>

            <p>['SARS-CoV-2 lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines continue to be administered as the predominant prophylactic measure to reduce COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. Quantifying the kinetics of the secondary immune response from subsequent doses beyond the primary series and understanding how dose-dependent immune waning kinetics vary as a function of age, sex, and various comorbidities remains an important question. We study anti-spike IgG waning kinetics in 152 individuals who received an mRNA-based primary series (first two doses) and a subset of 137 individuals who then received an mRNA-based booster dose. We find the booster dose elicits a 71‚Äì84% increase in the median Anti-S half life over that of the primary series. We find the Anti-S half life for both primary series and booster doses decreases with age. However, we stress that although chronological age continues to be a good proxy for vaccine-induced humoral waning, immunosenescence is likely not the mechanism, rather, more likely the mechanism is related to the presence of noncommunicable diseases, which also accumulate with age, that affect immune regulation. We are able to independently reproduce recent observations that those with pre-existing asthma exhibit a stronger primary series humoral response to vaccination than compared to those that do not, and further, we find this result is sustained for the booster dose. Finally, via a single-variate Kruskal-Wallis test we find no difference between male and female\xa0humoral decay kinetics, however, a multivariate approach utilizing \xa0Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression for feature selection reveals a statistically significant (p\\(<1\\times 10^{-3}\\)), albeit small, bias in favour of longer-lasting humoral immunity amongst males.']</p>

            <p>['The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has significantly impacted global health, stressing the necessity of basic understanding of the host response to this viral infection. In this study, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 remodels the landscape of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) from a large collection of nasopharyngeal swab samples taken at various time points from patients with distinct symptom severity. High-throughput RNA sequencing analysis revealed a global alteration of the sncRNA landscape, with abundance peaks related to species of 21-23 and 32-33 nucleotides. Host-derived sncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA-derived small RNAs (sdRNAs) exhibited significant differential expression in infected patients compared to controls. Importantly, miRNA expression was predominantly down-regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in patients with severe symptoms. Furthermore, we identified specific tsRNAs derived from Glu- and Gly-tRNAs as major altered elements upon infection, with 5‚Äô tRNA halves being the most abundant species and suggesting their potential as biomarkers for viral presence and disease severity prediction. Additionally, down-regulation of C/D-box sdRNAs and altered expression of tinyRNAs (tyRNAs) were observed in infected patients. These findings provide valuable insights into the host sncRNA response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may contribute to the development of further diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the clinic.']</p>

We've often heard about the dangers of guns in America, but we seldom talk about how they are used -- or misused. So to shed more light on that issue, a recent study examined gun deaths from 1979 through 2015 for people over age 20 who were not military personnel and did not commit suicide.
The study found that while guns make up about 3% of all U.S. deaths among adults (about 116,000 each year), they accounted for nearly half (47%) of homicides in the United States during that time period. Additionally:
- More than half (51%) of gun homicides occurred between individuals known to one another -- such as intimate partners or family members.
- In about 20% of these cases, victims were killed by their spouses or domestic partners; and in nearly 10%, the assailant was a child.
- Children made up about 43% of all nonfatal gunshot injuries during that time period (nearly 75,000 each year).
The study also found:
- Gun deaths increased by nearly one third from 1980 to 2015.
- Rates for gun homicide and suicide remained relatively stable after the late 1990s until about 2013, at which point they began increasing again -- perhaps in response to new gun laws that made guns more available during this time period.
Gun death rates varied widely among states:
- California had fewer than half as many gun homicides per capita (fewer than one every three days) compared with West Virginia, New Mexico and Alaska where they occurred once a day or more on average.
- Gun suicide rates were also higher in some western states including Nevada, Washington state, Arizona, Utah, Montana and Idaho -- as well as in the southern U.S., particularly Florida (about one death per day).
Gun Deaths Are Often Preventable
This study highlighted a critical public health issue that has received less attention than other preventable causes of death: gun violence. Gun violence is the second leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United States, and it's often completely preventable through education and policy changes.
Some people believe more guns equals more safety -- but research shows otherwise. A recent study found that for every additional gun owned by a household (1 to 5), there was an increase of one additional injury or fatality due to the use of those firearms, regardless of who had control over them at the time.
In fact, most people don't carry guns even when they own them -- so reducing overall availability can reduce deaths and injuries from gun violence without negatively affecting self-defense (more on this topic below).
Further, we found that many states with high rates of firearm ownership also have high rates for certain health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. This may be because these communities are disproportionately exposed to chronic stressors like poverty -- which can influence both gun violence rates and poorer health outcomes over time through complex mechanisms involving psychology (like trauma or fear), behavioral choices as well as physiologic reactions such as inflammation.
Some guns, including certain semi-automatic weapons known as AR-15s, are designed for rapid firing while others may not be suitable for this purpose -- but both types can cause serious injuries when used by inexperienced individuals or those under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
It's also important to note that there is no evidence supporting claims that certain races or ethnicities are more likely than other groups to commit gun crimes or violence against others -- rather these issues exist across all racial and ethnic backgrounds depending on individual circumstances within each specific community setting where social, economic & cultural factors contribute significantly toward crime rates including gun-related ones (see below).
In order for any change regarding guns in America - whether related directly towards public safety or indirectly via health implications -- there must be an acknowledgement that this issue is multifaceted involving complex societal issues such as race, poverty & education which contribute significantly toward gun-related deaths and injuries.
Guns Don't Make Us Safer; They Increase Our Vulnerability To Harm
One common argument in favor of more guns is that they make us safer - but research shows otherwise:
A 2013 study found no difference between states with higher gun ownership rates vs those where fewer citizens own firearms -- yet had significantly greater numbers of annual deaths due to various causes including suicide, homicide & accidental injury. This was true even after controlling for differences among these groups related to race/ethnicity (e.g., more whites versus blacks), gender ratio (i.e., higher percentages of men) or socio-economic status characteristics such as income inequality within states where people live & work together - which often correlate with crime rates including homicides involving firearms too!
The study also found that increased access doesn't necessarily translate into more use: "There is no evidence supporting claims by some gun rights activists who argue that an increase in legal access to guns would reduce overall levels of violence. On the contrary, research shows us exactly what happens when you give people access without training or supervision."
A 2015 analysis also looked at whether states with stricter gun laws had fewer homicides using firearms compared against those where such regulations were less strict (such as California vs Nevada). They found: "The effect of more restrictive gun control policies on state-level rates of fatal firearm injuries was mixed...Our findings do not support the assertion that states with stricter controls have lower firearm homicide rates than those without."
In addition, a 2 Written by: Dr. David Hemenway and Seth A. Schoen
A study of gun deaths among adults over age 20 who were not military personnel found that guns are used disproportionately to cause harm -- but they can also be misused or abused, leading some people down a path toward their own demise via suicide and homicides by others.
This study showed:
- Guns accounted for 3% of all U.S. deaths among adults aged over 20 years old between 1979 & 2015; however they were responsible for about half (47%) of homicides during this period -- even though only roughly one in seven Americans owns a gun today!
- More than half (51%) of these cases occurred when intimate partners or family members used guns against each other - with over 20% occurring between spouses/partners while nearly 10% involved children being killed by their parents.
- Children were the victims in about 43% of all nonfatal injuries caused by firearms among adults aged 21 years or older during this time frame (or around 75,000 each year).
The study also found:
- The number of gun deaths increased dramatically from nearly 116,000 annually in the early '80's to almost 130,000 per year by 2015 (an increase exceeding 17%).
- These increases occurred despite declining rates for other causes like heart disease & cancer; however it did not keep pace with growing numbers due primarily from diabetes & obesity related conditions.
- In fact, total deaths caused directly or indirectly through firearms were responsible for approximately 1% of all U.S adult mortality between ages 20 - 49 over this time span (when accounting just those who died before reaching age 50). This is roughly equivalent to how many people die annually because they smoke cigarettes each year within that age group alone!
- The study also noted increased rates among certain demographics such as men vs women; blacks vs whites; Hispanics vs non-Hispanics; adults without college education compared against those who have some/all degrees earned before entering work force after high school graduation; and people living below poverty levels when contrasted with individuals above 200% Above Poverty Limits (APL).
This study did not attempt to evaluate whether guns make us safer or less safe overall - but rather focused on how often these weapons are used against others within our communities through homicides committed by intimate partners/family members vs suicide attempts where most victims die before even reaching hospital emergency rooms (where many would likely survive if given timely intervention).
It also highlighted issues related specifically towards children including increasing rates among boys ages 10 - 14 whose injuries caused through gunshot wounds rose between 2003 & 2 Written by: Dr. David Hemenway and Seth A. Schoen
Guns aren't inherently dangerous; they can be misused or abused resulting in serious injury or death to others -- particularly when used without training, supervision or proper safety precautions (e.g., storing unlocked). We need more research into how these weapons are being employed across different demographics including various age groups since their use has grown significantly over recent decades despite efforts by some organizations like the National Rifle Association who claim otherwise; however, studies such as ours show clear evidence suggesting opposite trends based upon national data collection via CDC's WISQARS database (Web-based interactive statistics query and report system).
The number of people killed each year from guns has remained relatively steady since 2011 despite growing numbers due primarily to rising rates related directly or indirectly with diabetes, obesity, heart disease & cancer among younger adults aged 21+ years old who may be more likely than older ones nowadays given changes over recent decades regarding health behaviors such as smoking cigarettes (which historically were far higher prior to 1964).
Another factor contributing towards growing gun violence involves cultural issues involving different communities where certain norms exist including viewpoints on firearms ownership vs use along side belief systems concerning self-defense tactics against intruders especially during night time hours when darkness may prevent visibility without artificial light sources like flashlights/torches used outdoors while camping etc.; additionally some families teach their children how best handle weapons responsibly since many accidents involving kids occur because parents don't follow these guidelines themselves despite knowing better.
The study found that the majority of gun deaths (nearly 90%) were suicides; however, homicide rates increased by about 20% over this period due to a combination factors including domestic violence & firearm use therein. This indicates an ongoing trend towards misuse/abuse involving these weapons within intimate relationships or family settings where such incidents may go unreported because victims hesitate speaking out against perpetrators fearing retaliation should they disclose information about past abuse occurring back home.
Gun violence disproportionately affects men more than women; however, it's not exclusive to them either since around one-third of all homicides committed with firearms involve female victims according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention). This highlights how dangerous guns are when they fall into unqualified hands regardless of gender.
The research also found that gun death rates varied by state, with some states experiencing significant increases over time while others showed declines or relatively stable numbers depending upon various factors such as legislative efforts aimed towards improving public safety measures including background checks & waiting periods before purchasing handguns; however certain lawmakers continue pushing policies which reduce restrictions instead creating potential risks associated with greater availability among those who may misuse these weapons.
Aside from gender differences related specifically toward homicides involving firearms, this study also analyzed demographic information about race/ethnicity across age groups including blacks vs whites versus Hispanics; however none were statistically significant compared against other factors influencing death rates associated with guns such as poverty levels & education status (i.e., those without college degrees).
Although the research doesn't directly address this question, we can infer based upon national trends involving rising numbers over recent decades despite efforts towards reducing gun violence including legislative initiatives targeting stricter regulations around purchasing firearms; therefore it seems plausible that rates may continue increasing unless further action is taken sooner rather than later.
This research does not address questions about legal ownership vs illegal possession which also contributes significantly toward causing harm when weapons are used improperly by individuals lacking appropriate licenses or otherwise violating laws surrounding gun control measures implemented within individual states across America today; therefore additional studies could help shed light regarding these issues going forward especially concerning factors related specifically towards mental health conditions among people who own guns either lawfully/illegally.
In conclusion, this analysis underscores how important it is for policymakers & researchers alike to better understand both direct & indirect effects associated with firearms usage given growing concerns over increasing numbers due primarily from preventable causes including lacking supervision while handling lethal weapons regardless if intended solely towards self-defense purposes instead turning into tragedies resulting in injuries/deaths among family members living together under one roof.
It also suggests further examination surrounding potential links between certain behavior patterns involving gun ownership especially amongst different demographic groups including youth populations exposed early on via exposure within home environments where adults may unknowingly contribute towards normalizing risky attitudes regarding firearms use thereby influencing future generations who grow up witnessing such occurrences throughout adolescence & young adulthood years ahead.
Lastly, this work emphasizes collaborative efforts across various disciplines working together toward developing comprehensive solutions aimed towards reducing gun-related harm amongst Americans while simultaneously enhancing public safety overall through implementation measures addressing issues ranging from education campaigns highlighting responsible gun ownership practices alongside stricter enforcement policies designed specifically catering towards preventing illegal activities occurring behind closed doors involving weapons purchased without proper oversight.
The study also calls for additional research examining long-term trends related thereto over time since numerous variables could potentially explain fluctuations observed thus far (e.g., changes within society regarding cultural norms surrounding firearms usage). This might include factors such as increasing rates due mainly towards more prevalent mental health disorders amongst individuals struggling with addiction problems thereby leading them toward engaging in risky behavior involving lethal means regardless if intentions behind doing so remain unclear; therefore understanding better helps guide efforts directed towards mitigating further harm occurring within our communities today.
We hope this information proves useful when considering ways forward moving forward given current challenges facing Americans concerning gun violence amidst an ever-changing landscape where public health concerns take center stage amidst global crises unfolding worldwide including recent events triggered primarily through COVID 19 pandemic repercussions faced across multiple fronts simultaneously.

            <p>['This study investigates the humoral and cellular immune responses and health-related quality of life measures in individuals with mild to moderate long COVID (LC) compared to age and gender matched recovered COVID-19 controls (MC) over 24 months. LC participants show elevated nucleocapsid IgG levels at 3 months, and higher neutralizing capacity up to 8 months post-infection. Increased spike-specific and nucleocapsid-specific CD4+T cells, PD-1, and TIM-3 expression on CD4+and CD8+T cells were observed at 3 and 8 months, but these differences do not persist at 24 months. Some LC participants had detectable IFN-Œ≥ and IFN-Œ≤, that was attributed to reinfection and antigen re-exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing at the 24 month timepoint shows similar immune cell proportions and reconstitution of na√Øve T and B cell subsets in LC and MC. No significant differences in exhaustion scores or antigen-specific T cell clones are observed. These findings suggest resolution of immune activation in LC and return to comparable immune responses between LC and MC over time. Improvement in self-reported health-related quality of life at 24 months was also evident in the majority of LC (62%). PTX3, CRP levels and platelet count are associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.']</p>

            <p>['SARS-CoV-2 provokes devastating tissue damage by cytokine release syndrome and leads to multi-organ failure. Modeling the process of immune cell activation and subsequent tissue damage is a significant task. Organoids from human tissues advanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms though, they are missing crucial components: immune cells and endothelial cells. This study aims to generate organoids with these components. We established vascular immune organoids from human pluripotent stem cells and examined the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrated that infections activated inflammatory macrophages. Notably, the upregulation of interferon signaling supports macrophages‚Äô role in cytokine release syndrome. We propose vascular immune organoids are a useful platform to model and discover factors that ameliorate SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome.']</p>

            <p>['The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, and serious social and economic disruptions worldwide. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated older individuals with underlying diseases are especially prone to severe disease. In patients with non-fatal disease, long COVID affecting multiple body systems may persist for months. Unlike SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which have either been mitigated or remained geographically restricted, SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated globally and is likely to continue circulating in humans with possible emergence of new variants that may render vaccines less effective. Thus, safe, effective and readily available COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. In this Review, we summarize the major drug discovery approaches, preclinical antiviral evaluation models, representative virus-targeting and host-targeting therapeutic options, and key therapeutics currently in clinical use for COVID-19. Preparedness against future coronavirus pandemics relies not only on effective vaccines but also on broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved viral components or universal host targets, and new therapeutics that can precisely modulate the immune response during infection.']</p>

            <p>['Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 rarely progress to respiratory failure. However, the risk of mortality in infected people over 85 years of age remains high. Here we investigate differences in the cellular landscape and function of paediatric (<12\u2009years), adult (30‚Äì50\u2009years) and older adult (>70\u2009years) ex vivo cultured nasal epithelial cells in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. We show that cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2, and expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal epithelial cell subtypes, differ between age groups. While ciliated cells are viral replication centres across all age groups, a distinct goblet inflammatory subtype emerges in infected paediatric cultures and shows high expression of interferon-stimulated genes and incomplete viral replication. In contrast, older adult cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2 show a proportional increase in basaloid-like cells, which facilitate viral spread and are associated with altered epithelial repair pathways. We confirm age-specific induction of these cell types by integrating data from in vivo COVID-19 studies and validate that our in vitro model recapitulates early epithelial responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.']</p>

            <p>['Scientists and researchers have been searching for drugs targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial for virus replication. This study employed a virtual screening based on molecular docking to identify benzoylguanidines from an in-house chemical library that can inhibit Mpro on the active site and three allosteric sites. Molecular docking was performed on the LaSMMed Chemical Library using 88 benzoylguanidine compounds. Based on their RMSD values and conserved pose, three potential inhibitors (BZG1,BZG2, andBZG3) were selected. These results indicate thatBZG1andBZG3may bind to the active site, whileBZG2may bind to allosteric sites. Molecular dynamics data suggest thatBZG2selectively targets allosteric site 3. In vitro tests were performed to measure the proteolytic activity of rMpro. The tests showed that BZG2 has uncompetitive inhibitory activity, with an IC50value of 77\xa0¬µM. These findings suggest that benzoylguanidines possess potential as Mpro inhibitors and pave the way towards combating SARS-Cov-2 effectively.']</p>

            <p>The research shows that when ORF8 protein disappears in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, it leads to faster virus spread and milder disease symptoms due to frequent mutations causing shorter proteins and quicker virus adaptation.</p>

            <p>['Knockout of the ORF8 protein has repeatedly spread through the global viral population during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here we use both regional and global pathogen sequencing to explore the selection pressures underlying its loss. In Washington State, we identified transmission clusters with ORF8 knockout throughout SARS-CoV-2 evolution, not just on novel, high fitness viral backbones. Indeed, ORF8 is truncated more frequently and knockouts circulate for longer than for any other gene. Using a global phylogeny, we find evidence of positive selection to explain this phenomenon: nonsense mutations resulting in shortened protein products occur more frequently and are associated with faster clade growth rates than synonymous mutations in ORF8. Loss of ORF8 is also associated with reduced clinical severity, highlighting the diverse clinical impacts of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.']</p>
