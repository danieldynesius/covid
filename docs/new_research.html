            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>A nasally delivered chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) is currently used in India (iNCOVACC). Here, we update this vaccine by creating ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-BA.5-S, which encodes a prefusion-stabilized BA.5 spike protein. Whereas serum neutralizing antibody responses induced by monovalent or bivalent adenoviral vaccines were poor against the antigenically distant XBB.1.5 strain and insufficient to protect in passive transfer experiments, mucosal antibody and cross-reactive memory T cell responses were robust, and protection was evident against WA1/2020 D614G and Omicron variants BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 in mice and hamsters. However, depletion of memory CD8+T cells before XBB.1.5 challenge resulted in loss of protection against upper and lower respiratory tract infection. Thus, nasally delivered vaccines stimulate mucosal immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains, and cross-reactive memory CD8+T cells mediate protection against lung infection by antigenically distant strains in the setting of low serum levels of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The optimal interval between the first and second doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has not been thoroughly evaluated. Employing a target trial emulation approach, we compared the effectiveness of different interdose intervals among >6 million mRNA vaccine recipients in Georgia, USA, from December 2020 to March 2022. We compared three protocols defined by interdose interval: recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17-25 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; 24-32 days for Moderna), late-but-allowable (26-42 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; 33-49 days for Moderna), and late (‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ43 days for Pfizer-BioNTech; ‚â•50 days for Moderna). In the short-term, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lowest under the FDA-recommended protocol. Longer-term, the late-but-allowable protocol resulted in the lowest risk (risk ratio on Day 120 after the first dose administration compared to the FDA-recommended protocol: 0.83 [95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.84]). Here, we showed that delaying the second dose by 1-2 weeks may provide stronger long-term protection.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This study analyzes the dihedral angles of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and identifies dominant frequencies in the 23‚Äì63 MHz range, suggesting potential residues for vaccine and drug design to combat COVID-19.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to viral infection of human host cells which ultimately results in COVID-19. In this study we analyzed the behavior of dihedral angles (phi and psi) of the wild-type spike protein over time from molecular dynamics and identified that their oscillations are dominated by a few discrete, relatively low frequencies in the 23‚Äì63¬†MHz range with 42.969¬†MHz being the most prevalent frequency sampled by the oscillations. We thus observed the spike protein to favor certain frequencies more than others. Gaps in the tally of all observed frequencies for low-abundance amino acids also suggests that the frequency components of dihedral angle oscillations may be a function of position in the primary structure since relatively more abundant amino acids lacked gaps. Lastly, certain residues identified in the literature as constituting the inside of a druggable pocket, as well as others identified as allosteric sites, are observed in our data to have distinctive time domain profiles. This motivated us to propose additional residues with similar time domain profiles, which may be of potential interest to the vaccine and drug design communities for further investigation. Thus these findings indicate that there is a particular frequency domain profile for the spike protein hidden within the time domain data and this information, perhaps with the suggested residues, might provide additional insight into therapeutic development strategies for COVID-19 and beyond.</p>

            <p>This research identifies rate-limiting factors affecting Cas12b- and Cas13a-mediated detection, and optimizes these to improve the sensitivity and speed of one-pot testing, making CRISPR-based assays competitive for widespread use in pathogen detection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Despite the great potential of CRISPR-based detection, it has not been competitive with other market diagnostics for on-site and in-home testing. Here we dissect the rate-limiting factors that undermine the performance of Cas12b- and Cas13a-mediated detection. In one-pot testing, Cas12b interferes with loop-mediated isothermal amplification by binding to and cleaving the amplicon, while Cas13a directly degrades the viral RNA, reducing its amplification. We found that the protospacer-adjacent motif-interacting domain engineered Cas12b accelerated one-pot testing with 10‚Äì10,000-fold improved sensitivity, and detected 85 out of 85 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples with a sensitivity of 0.5‚Äâcp‚ÄâŒºl‚àí1, making it superior to wild-type Cas12b. In parallel, by diminishing the interference of Cas13a with viral RNA, the optimized Cas13a-based assay detected 86 out of 87 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples at room temperature in 30‚Äâmin with a sensitivity of 0.5‚Äâcp‚ÄâŒºl‚àí1. The relaxed reaction conditions and improved performance of CRISPR-based assays make them competitive for widespread use in pathogen detection.</p>

            <p>The research identifies a new SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, XBB.1.5, which evolved from XBB.1 through specific mutations and suggests that these changes may result in reduced virulence compared to the original XBB.1 strain.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Circulation of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB has resulted in the emergence of XBB.1.5, a new Variant of Interest. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that XBB.1.5 evolved from XBB.1 by acquiring the S486P spike (S) mutation, subsequent to the acquisition of a nonsense mutation in ORF8. Neutralization assays showed similar abilities of immune escape between XBB.1.5 and XBB.1. We determine the structural basis for the interaction between human ACE2 and the S protein of XBB.1.5, showing similar overall structures between the S proteins of XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. We provide the intrinsic pathogenicity of XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 in hamsters. Importantly, we find that the ORF8 nonsense mutation of XBB.1.5 resulted in impairment of MHC suppression. In vivo experiments using recombinant viruses reveal that the XBB.1.5 mutations are involved with reduced virulence of XBB.1.5. Together, our study identifies the two viral functions defined the difference between XBB.1 and XBB.1.5.</p>

            <p>A study has developed a 1 micrometer-thick, porous nanocomposite coating with antifouling and electroconducting properties to enhance the sensitivity of electrochemical sensors, enabling simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, antigen, and host antibody in clinical specimens.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Development of coating technologies for electrochemical sensors that consistently exhibit antifouling activities in diverse and complex biological environments over extended time is vital for effective medical devices and diagnostics. Here, we describe a micrometer-thick, porous nanocomposite coating with both antifouling and electroconducting properties that enhances the sensitivity of electrochemical sensors. Nozzle printing of oil-in-water emulsion is used to create a 1 micrometer thick coating composed of cross-linked albumin with interconnected pores and gold nanowires. The layer resists biofouling and maintains rapid electron transfer kinetics for over one month when exposed directly to complex biological fluids, including serum and nasopharyngeal secretions. Compared to a thinner (nanometer thick) antifouling coating made with drop casting or a spin coating of the same thickness, the thick porous nanocomposite sensor exhibits sensitivities that are enhanced by 3.75- to 17-fold when three different target biomolecules are tested. As a result, emulsion-coated, multiplexed electrochemical sensors can carry out simultaneous detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid, antigen, and host antibody in clinical specimens with high sensitivity and specificity. This thick porous emulsion coating technology holds promise in addressing hurdles currently restricting the application of electrochemical sensors for point-of-care diagnostics, implantable devices, and other healthcare monitoring systems.</p>

            <p>This research investigates if AI classifiers can accurately predict SARS-CoV-2 infection using respiratory audio, finding that they perform better when accounting for confounding factors like user-reported symptoms; however, the study suggests that audio-based classifiers may not be as effective as predictions based on user-reported symptoms in practical settings.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Recent work has reported that respiratory audio-trained AI classifiers can accurately predict SARS-CoV-2 infection status. However, it has not yet been determined whether such model performance is driven by latent audio biomarkers with true causal links to SARS-CoV-2 infection or by confounding effects, such as recruitment bias, present in observational studies. Here we undertake a large-scale study of audio-based AI classifiers as part of the UK government‚Äôs pandemic response. We collect a dataset of audio recordings from 67,842 individuals, with linked metadata, of whom 23,514 had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2. In an unadjusted analysis, similar to that in previous works, AI classifiers predict SARS-CoV-2 infection status with high accuracy (ROC‚ÄìAUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.846 [0.838‚Äì0.854]). However, after matching on measured confounders, such as self-reported symptoms, performance is much weaker (ROC‚ÄìAUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.619 [0.594‚Äì0.644]). Upon quantifying the utility of audio-based classifiers in practical settings, we find them to be outperformed by predictions on the basis of user-reported symptoms. We make best-practice recommendations for handling recruitment bias, and for assessing audio-based classifiers by their utility in relevant practical settings. Our work provides insights into the value of AI audio analysis and the importance of study design and treatment of confounders in AI-enabled diagnostics.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Antibody tests are used as surveillance tools for informing health policy making. However, results may vary by type of antibody assay and timing of sample collection following infection. Long-term longitudinal cohort studies on antibody assay seropositivity have remained limited, especially among Asian populations. Using blood samples obtained at health physicals (2020‚Äì2022) of healthcare workers (mass vaccinated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) at a Japanese medical center, we measured N-specific antibodies using two commercially available systems. Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 measures total antibodies and Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG measures only IgG. Among 2538 participants, seroprevalence was found to be 16.6% via total antibody assay versus 12.9% by IgG-only (including grayzone) by mid-June 2022. For 219 cases with a previous PCR-confirmed infection, positivity was 97.3% using total antibody assay versus 76.3% using IgG-only assay at the 2022 health physical. Using PCR positive test date as day 0, while the positivity of the total antibody assay was retained for the entire study period (until more than 24-months post-infection), the IgG-only assay‚Äôs positivity declined after month 4. The Mantel‚ÄìHaenszel test found a significant difference in the two assays‚Äô seropositivity, between stratified groups of ‚Äúwithin 3¬†months‚Äù and ‚Äú4¬†months or more‚Äù from infection (P<‚Äâ0.001). Our study found significant differences in seropositivity over time of total antibody versus IgG-only assays, suggesting an optimal assay for retaining sensitivity over the entire infection period when designing seroprevalence studies.</p>

            <p>This study identifies potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies from a vaccinated donor that can effectively neutralize diverse coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants, offering promising avenues for the development of therapeutic antibody drugs.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The current SARS-CoV-2 variants strikingly evade all authorized monoclonal antibodies and threaten the efficacy of serum-neutralizing activity elicited by vaccination or prior infection, urging the need to develop antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses. Here, we identified both potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies from a five-dose vaccinated donor who exhibited cross-reactive serum-neutralizing activity against diverse coronaviruses. Through single B-cell sorting and sequencing followed by a tailor-made computational pipeline, we successfully selected 86 antibodies with potential cross-neutralizing ability from 684 antibody sequences. Among them, PW5-570 potently neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants that arose prior to Omicron BA.5, and the other three could broadly neutralize all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, SARS-CoV and their related sarbecoviruses (Pangolin-GD, RaTG13, WIV-1, and SHC014). Cryo-EM analysis demonstrates that these antibodies have diverse neutralization mechanisms, such as disassembling spike trimers, or binding to RBM or SD1 to affect ACE2 binding. In addition, prophylactic administration of these antibodies significantly protects nasal turbinate and lung infections against BA.1, XBB.1, and SARS-CoV viral challenge in golden Syrian hamsters, respectively. Importantly, post-exposure treatment with PW5-5 and PW5-535 also markedly protects against XBB.1 challenge in these models. This study reveals the potential utility of computational process to assist screening cross-reactive antibodies, as well as the potency of vaccine-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies against current SARS-CoV-2 variants and related sarbecoviruses, offering promising avenues for the development of broad therapeutic antibody drugs.</p>

            <p>The research investigates the genetic determinants of COVID-19 mortality by conducting a case-only genome-wide survival analysis on 3904 patients from the GEN-COVID and other European series, finding that germline variants may modulate COVID-19 risk of death through the regulation of gene expression in immune response and lung function pathways.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely among patients, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Host genetics is one of the factors that contributes to this variability as previously reported by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI), which identified sixteen loci associated with COVID-19 severity. Herein, we investigated the genetic determinants of COVID-19 mortality, by performing a case-only genome-wide survival analysis, 60¬†days after infection, of 3904 COVID-19 patients from the GEN-COVID and other European series (EGAS00001005304 study of the COVID-19 HGI). Using imputed genotype data, we carried out a survival analysis using the Cox model adjusted for age, age2, sex, series, time of infection, and the first ten principal components. We observed a genome-wide significant (P-value‚Äâ<‚Äâ5.0‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8) association of the rs117011822 variant, on chromosome 11, of rs7208524 on chromosome 17, approaching the genome-wide threshold (P-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.19‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8). A total of 113 variants were associated with survival atP-value‚Äâ<‚Äâ1.0‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí5and most of them regulated the expression of genes involved in immune response (e.g., CD300 and KLR genes), or in lung repair and function (e.g., FGF19 and CDH13). Overall, our results suggest that germline variants may modulate COVID-19 risk of death, possibly through the regulation of gene expression in immune response and lung function pathways.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Here we report the characterization of 17T2, a SARS-CoV-2 pan-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody isolated from a COVID-19 convalescent individual infected during the first pandemic wave. 17T2 is a class 1 VH1-58/Œ∫3-20 antibody, derived from a receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA+memory B cell, with a broad neutralizing activity against former and new SARS-CoV-2 variants, including XBB.1.16 and BA.2.86 Omicron subvariants. Consistently, 17T2 demonstrates in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity against Omicron BA.1.1 infection in K18-hACE2 mice. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction shows that 17T2 binds the BA.1 spike with the RBD in ‚Äúup‚Äù position and blocks the receptor binding motif, as other structurally similar antibodies do, including S2E12. Yet, unlike S2E12, 17T2 retains its neutralizing activity against all variants tested, probably due to a larger RBD contact area. These results highlight the impact of small structural antibody changes on neutralizing performance and identify 17T2 as a potential candidate for future clinical interventions.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The rapid development of safe and effective vaccines helped to prevent severe disease courses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and to mitigate the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is evidence that vaccination may reduce the risk of developing post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC), this effect may depend on the viral variant. Therapeutic effects of post-infection vaccination have been discussed but the data for individuals with PCC remains inconclusive. In addition, extremely rare side effects after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may resemble the heterogeneous PCC phenotype. Here, we analyze the plasma levels of 25 cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 directed antibodies in 540 individuals with or without PCC relative to one or two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations as well as in 20 uninfected individuals one month after their initial mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. While none of the SARS-CoV-2 na√Øve individuals reported any persisting sequelae or exhibited PCC-like dysregulation of plasma cytokines, we detected lower levels of IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18 in patients with ongoing PCC who received one or two vaccinations at a median of six months after infection as compared to unvaccinated PCC patients. This reduction correlated with less frequent reporting of persisting gastrointestinal symptoms. These data suggest that post-infection vaccination in patients with PCC might be beneficial in a subgroup of individuals displaying gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), sparked an international debate on effective ways to prevent and treat the virus. Specifically, there were many varying opinions on the use of ivermectin (IVM) throughout the world, with minimal research to support either side. IVM is an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug that was discovered in the 1970s and was found to show antiviral activity. The objective of this study is to examine the binding behavior and rates of association and dissociation between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), IVM, and their combination using aminopropylsilane (APS) biosensors as surrogates for the hydrophobic interaction between the viral protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to determine the potential of IVM as a repurposed drug for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment. The IVM, RBD, and combination binding kinetics were analyzed using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and validated with multiple in silico techniques including protein‚Äìligand docking, molecular dynamics simulation, molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA), and principal component analysis (PCA). Our results suggest that with increasing IVM concentrations the association rate with the hydrophobic biosensor increases with a simultaneous decrease in dissociation. Significant kinetic changes to RBD, when combined with IVM, were found only at a concentration a thousand times the approved dosage with minimal changes found over a 35-min time period. Our study suggests that IVM is not an effective preventative or treatment method at the currently approved dosage.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 reinfections increased substantially after Omicron variants emerged. Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited. Here we studied ~45,000 reinfections from the UK‚Äôs national COVID-19 Infection Survey and quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants. Reinfections were associated with lower viral load and lower percentages of self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, estimated protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Estimated protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year). Those 14‚Äì180‚Äâdays after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection than those >180‚Äâdays from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30‚Äì45‚Äâyears, and with either low or high viral load in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; both viral evolution and waning immunity are independently associated with reinfection.</p>

            <p>Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of blood is typically used for gene expression analysis in biomedical research but is still rarely used in clinical practice. In this study, we propose that RNA-seq should be considered a diagnostic tool, as it offers not only insights into aberrant gene expression and splicing but also delivers additional readouts on immune cell type composition as well as B-cell and T-cell receptor (BCR/TCR) repertoires. We demonstrate that RNA-seq offers insights into a patient‚Äôs immune status via integrative analysis of RNA-seq data from patients infected with various SARS-CoV-2 variants (in total 196 samples with up to 200 million reads sequencing depth). We compare the results of computational cell-type deconvolution methods (e.g., MCP-counter, xCell, EPIC, quanTIseq) to complete blood count data, the current gold standard in clinical practice. We observe varying levels of lymphocyte depletion and significant differences in neutrophil levels between SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, we identify B and T cell receptor (BCR/TCR) sequences using the tools MiXCR and TRUST4 to show that‚Äîcombined with sequence alignments and BLASTp‚Äîthey could be used to classify a patient's disease. Finally, we investigated the sequencing depth required for such analyses and concluded that 10 million reads per sample is sufficient. In conclusion, our study reveals that computational cell-type deconvolution and BCR/TCR methods using bulk RNA-seq analyses can supplement missing CBC data and offer insights into immune responses, disease severity, and pathogen-specific immunity, all achievable with a sequencing depth of 10 million reads per sample.</p>

            <p>This research used computational methods to analyze coronavirus sequences, identify key interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's binding region with heparan sulfate, and screened natural compounds for potential antiviral candidates, finding Acetoside, Hyperoside, and Isoquercitrin as promising options.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants diminished the efficacy of current antiviral drugs and vaccines. Hence, identifying highly conserved sequences and potentially druggable pockets for drug development was a promising strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In viral infection, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins are essential in binding to the host receptor. Others, Heparan sulfate (HS), widely distributed on the surface of host cells, is thought to play a central role in the viral infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it might be a reasonable strategy for antiviral drug design to interfere with the RBD in the HS binding site. In this study, we used computational approaches to analyze multiple sequences of coronaviruses and reveal important information about the binding of HS to RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results showed that the potential hot-spots, including R454 and E471, in RBD, exhibited strong interactions in the HS-RBD binding region. Therefore, we screened different compounds in the natural product database towards these hot-spots to find potential antiviral candidates usingLibDock,Autodock vinaand furthermore applying the MD simulation inAMBER20. The results showed three potential natural compounds, including Acetoside (ACE), Hyperoside (HYP), and Isoquercitrin (ISO), had a strong affinity to the RBD. Our results demonstrate a feasible approach to identify potential antiviral agents by evaluating the binding interaction between viral glycoproteins and host receptors. The present study provided the applications of the structure-based computational approach for designing and developing of new antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The development of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been essential to control COVID-19, but significant challenges remain. One problem is intramuscular administration, which does not induce robust mucosal immune responses in the upper airways‚Äîthe primary site of infection and virus shedding. Here we compare the efficacy of a mucosal, replication-competent yet fully attenuated virus vaccine, sCPD9-ŒîFCS, and the monovalent mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1 and Omicron BA.5 in two scenarios. Firstly, we assessed the protective efficacy of the vaccines by exposing vaccinated male Syrian hamsters to infected counterparts. Secondly, we evaluated transmission of the challenge virus from vaccinated and subsequently challenged male hamsters to na√Øve contacts. Our findings demonstrate that the live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) sCPD9-ŒîFCS significantly outperformed the mRNA vaccine in preventing virus transmission in both scenarios. Our results provide evidence for the advantages of locally administered LAVs over intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccines in preventing infection and reducing virus transmission.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In the context of continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), one strategy to prevent the severe outcomes of COVID-19 is developing safe and effective broad-spectrum vaccines. Here, we present preclinical studies of a RBD vaccine derived from the Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variant adjuvanted with Alum. The Gamma-adapted RBD vaccine is more immunogenic than the Ancestral RBD vaccine in terms of inducing broader neutralizing antibodies. The Gamma RBD presents more immunogenic B-cell restricted epitopes and induces a higher proportion of specific-B cells and plasmablasts than the Ancestral RBD version. The Gamma-adapted vaccine induces antigen¬†specific T cell immune responses and confers protection against Ancestral and Omicron BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice. Moreover, the¬†Gamma¬†RBD vaccine induces higher and broader neutralizing antibody activity than homologous booster vaccination in mice previously primed with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms. Our study indicates that the adjuvanted Gamma RBD vaccine is highly immunogenic and a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate.</p>

            <p>This study investigated the relationship between plasma antibody levels and baseline conditions or clinical outcomes in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, finding that mild cases had higher RBD IgG antibody levels and a strong correlation between antibody levels and vaccination status in severe/critical cases.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact global public health. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2¬†(SARS-CoV-2) has become less virulent as it mutates, prompting China to ease restrictions at the end of 2022. With the complete reopening, a surge in COVID-19 cases has ensued. Therefore, we conducted a study to explore the correlation between plasma antibody levels and baseline conditions or clinical outcomes in severe and critical patients. We collected the basic information of 79 included patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay¬†(ELISA) tests were performed on plasma samples. The receptor-binding domain¬†(RBD) IgG antibody level of the mild group was significantly higher than that of the severe/critical group (P=‚Äâ0.00049). And in the severe/critical group, there existed an association between plasma antibody levels and age (P<‚Äâ0.001, r‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ0.471), as well as plasma antibody levels and vaccination status (P=‚Äâ0.00147, eta2=‚Äâ0.211). Besides, the level of plasma antibody seemed to be moderately correlated with the age, indicating the need for heightened attention to infections in the elderly. And plasma antibody levels were strongly associated with vaccination status in the severe/critical patients.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Necroptosis, a type of lytic cell death executed by the pseudokinase Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like (MLKL) has been implicated in the detrimental inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We minimally and extensively passaged a single clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate to create models of mild and severe disease in mice allowing us to dissect the role of necroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 disease pathogenesis. We infected wild-type and MLKL-deficient mice and found no significant differences in viral loads or lung pathology. In our model of severe COVID-19, MLKL-deficiency did not alter the host response, ameliorate weight loss, diminish systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, or prevent lethality in aged animals. Our in vivo models indicate that necroptosis is dispensable in the pathogenesis of mild and severe COVID-19.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>B and T cell responses were evaluated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) after 1 or 2 weeks of methotrexate (MTX) withdrawal following each COVID-19 vaccine dose and compared with those who maintained MTX. Adult RA and PsA patients treated with MTX were recruited and randomly assigned to 3 groups: MTX-maintenance (n=‚Äâ72), MTX-withdrawal for 1 week (n=‚Äâ71) or MTX-withdrawal for 2 weeks (n=‚Äâ73). Specific antibodies to several SARS-CoV-2 antigens and interferon (IFN)-Œ≥ and interleukin (IL)-21 responses were assessed. MTX withdrawal in patients without previous COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of anti-RBD IgG and neutralising antibodies, especially in the 2-week withdrawal group and with higher IFN-Œ≥ secretion upon stimulation with pools of SARS-CoV-2 S peptides. No increment of RA/PsA relapses was detected across groups. Our data indicate that two-week MTX interruption following COVID-19 vaccination in patients with RA or PsA improves humoral and cellular immune responses.</p>

In addition, the study suggests that mRNA vaccination provides greater protection against severe disease compared to natural infection, with a higher IgG3-dependent humoral profile.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Although young children generally experience mild symptoms following infection with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute and long-term complications can occur. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines elicit robust immunoglobulin profiles in children ages 5 years and older, and in adults, corresponding with substantial protection against hospitalizations and severe disease. Whether similar immune responses and humoral protection can be observed in vaccinated infants and young children, who have a developing and vulnerable immune system, remains poorly understood. To study the impact of mRNA vaccination on the humoral immunity of infant, we use a system serology approach to comprehensively profile antibody responses in a cohort of children ages 6 months to 5 years who were vaccinated with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (25‚ÄâŒºg). Responses are compared with vaccinated adults (100‚ÄâŒºg), in addition to naturally infected toddlers and young children. Despite their lower vaccine dose, vaccinated toddlers elicit a functional antibody response as strong as adults, with higher antibody-dependent phagocytosis compared to adults, without report of side effects. Moreover, mRNA vaccination is associated with a higher IgG3-dependent humoral profile against SARS-CoV-2 compared to natural infection, supporting that mRNA vaccination is effective at eliciting a robust antibody response in toddlers and young children.</p>

            <p>The abstract reports that Omicron is more infectious than Delta due to mutations in its spike protein, which allow it to enter nasal cells without relying on protease enzymes. This suggests that Omicron can bypass immune responses and antiviral factors in the nose, enhancing its spread.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Omicron emerged following COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, displaced previous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern worldwide, and gave rise to lineages that continue to spread. Here, we show that Omicron exhibits increased infectivity in primary adult upper airway tissue relative to Delta. Using recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 and nasal epithelial cells cultured at the liquid-air interface, we show that mutations unique to Omicron Spike enable enhanced entry into nasal tissue. Unlike earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, our findings suggest that Omicron enters nasal cells independently of serine transmembrane proteases and instead relies upon metalloproteinases to catalyze membrane fusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this entry pathway unlocked by Omicron Spike enables evasion from constitutive and interferon-induced antiviral factors that restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry following attachment. Therefore, the increased transmissibility exhibited by Omicron in humans may be attributed not only to its evasion of vaccine-elicited adaptive immunity, but also to its superior invasion of nasal epithelia and resistance to the cell-intrinsic barriers present therein.</p>

            <p>Our research found that patients frequently retested using a limited number of RT-PCR tests to diagnose COVID-19. Patients tend to be retested around day 7 after the initial positive result, and their Ct-values increase over time. This suggests that Ct-cutoffs may not always be reliable for determining when to stop testing.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is a critical and, at times, limited resource. Frequent Retesting of patients may strain testing infrastructure unduly. Recommendations that include cycle threshold (Ct) cutoffs may incentivize early retesting when the Ct value is reported. We aimed to investigate patterns of retesting in association with initial Ct-values. We performed a retrospective analysis of RT-PCR results (including Ct-values) for patients from whom ‚â•‚Äâ2 samples were collected within 14¬†days, the first of which had to be positive. We calculated absolute and baseline-corrected kinetics of Ct-values over time, as well as the median initial Ct-values in dependence of the timing of the first retesting and the time until RT-PCR negativity for SARS-CoV-2. Retesting after an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was most commonly performed on day 7, with patients being retested as early as day 1. The majority of patients retested within 14¬†days remained SARS-CoV-2 positive in the RT-PCR. Baseline-corrected Ct-values showed a quasi-linear increase over 14¬†days since the initial positive result. Both the timing until the first retesting and until RT-PCR negativity were inversely correlated with the initial Ct-value. The timing of retesting after a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR appears to be significantly influenced by the initial Ct-value. Although it can be assumed that Ct-values will increase steadily over time, strategies that rely on rigid Ct-cutoffs should be discussed critically, not only because of methodological caveats but also because of the strain on testing infrastructure caused by the incentive for early retesting that Ct-values apparently represent.</p>

Here, we identify a highly conserved neutralizing epitope targeted by a broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody BA7535, which demonstrates high neutralization potency against not only previous variants, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron BA.1-BA.5, but also more recently emerged Omicron subvariants, including BF.7, CH.1.1, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9.1, EG.5. Structural analysis of the Omicron Spike trimer with BA7535-Fab using cryo-EM indicates that BA7535 recognizes a highly conserved cryptic receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitope, avoiding most of the mutational hot spots in RBD. Furthermore, structural simulation based on the interaction of BA7535-Fab/RBD complexes dissects the broadly neutralizing effect of BA7535 against latest variants. Therapeutic and prophylactic treatment with BA7535 alone or in combination with BA7208 protected female mice from the circulating Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1 variant infection, suggesting the highly conserved neutralizing epitope serves as a potential target for developing highly potent therapeutic antibodies and vaccines.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>Two different versions of a vaccine for COVID-19 were tested on volunteers and found to be effective at increasing T cell and antibody response when used as a third dose. The vaccine containing the prefusion-stabilized spike protein led to more S1-specific responses, while the one with the native spike elicited more S2-specific responses. This shows how the type of virus protein being used in the vaccine can impact its effectiveness.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple vaccines were developed using platforms such as viral vectors and mRNA technology. Here, we report humoral and cellular immunogenicity data from human phase 1 clinical trials investigating two recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine candidates, MVA-SARS-2-S and MVA-SARS-2-ST, encoding the native and the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively. MVA-SARS-2-ST was more immunogenic than MVA-SARS-2-S, but both were less immunogenic compared to licensed mRNA- and ChAd-based vaccines in SARS-CoV-2 na√Øve individuals. In heterologous vaccination, previous MVA-SARS-2-S vaccination enhanced T cell functionality and MVA-SARS-2-ST boosted the frequency of T cells and S1-specific IgG levels when used as a third vaccination. While the vaccine candidate containing the prefusion-stabilized spike elicited predominantly S1-specific responses, immunity to the candidate with the native spike was skewed towards S2-specific responses. These data demonstrate how the spike antigen conformation, using the same viral vector, directly affects vaccine immunogenicity in humans.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This research suggests that a common cold virus called OC43 can cause our body to create T cells that can fight against the COVID-19 virus. This could potentially reduce the severity of COVID-19 cases in people who have previously been infected with OC43, but more research is needed to fully understand its implications for vaccines and treatments.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells are detected in some healthy unexposed individuals. Human studies indicate these T cells could be elicited by the common cold coronavirus OC43. To directly test this assumption and define the role of OC43-elicited T cells that are cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2, we develop a model of sequential infections with OC43 followed by SARS-CoV-2 in HLA-B*0702 and HLA-DRB1*0101Ifnar1‚àí/‚àítransgenic mice. We find that OC43 infection can elicit polyfunctional CD8+and CD4+effector T cells that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Furthermore, pre-exposure to OC43 reduces subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in the lung for a short-term in HLA-DRB1*0101Ifnar1‚àí/‚àítransgenic mice, and a longer-term in HLA-B*0702Ifnar1‚àí/‚àítransgenic mice. Depletion of CD4+T cells in HLA-DRB1*0101Ifnar1‚àí/‚àítransgenic mice with prior OC43 exposure results in increased viral burden in the lung but no change in virus-induced lung damage following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (versus CD4+T cell-sufficient mice), demonstrating that the OC43-elicited SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell-mediated cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 is partially dependent on CD4+T cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of the origin of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells and their effects on SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes, and also carry implications for development of broadly protective betacoronavirus vaccines.</p>

            <p>This study shows that imatinib treatment helps reduce the need for ventilation and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients by targeting inflammation and extracellular matrix turnover pathways, as seen through changes in 6385 plasma proteins.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The pathobiology of respiratory failure in COVID-19 consists of a complex interplay between viral cytopathic effects and a dysregulated host immune response. In critically ill patients, imatinib treatment demonstrated potential for reducing invasive ventilation duration and mortality. Here, we perform longitudinal profiling of 6385 plasma proteins in 318 hospitalised patients to investigate the biological processes involved in critical COVID-19, and assess the effects of imatinib treatment. Nine proteins measured at hospital admission accurately predict critical illness development. Next to dysregulation of inflammation, critical illness is characterised by pathways involving cellular adhesion, extracellular matrix turnover and tissue remodelling. Imatinib treatment attenuates protein perturbations associated with inflammation and extracellular matrix turnover. These proteomic alterations are contextualised using external pulmonary RNA-sequencing data of deceased COVID-19 patients and imatinib-treated Syrian hamsters. Together, we show that alveolar capillary barrier disruption in critical COVID-19 is reflected in the plasma proteome, and is attenuated with imatinib treatment. This study comprises a secondary analysis of both clinical data and plasma samples derived from a clinical trial that was registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020‚Äì001236‚Äì10,https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001236-10/NL) and Netherlands Trial Register (NL8491,https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8491).</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is known as one of the important risk factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we evaluate the impact of T2D and its genetic susceptibility on the severity and mortality of COVID-19, using 459,119 individuals in UK Biobank. Utilizing the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for T2D, we identified a significant association between T2D or T2D PRS, and COVID-19 severity. We further discovered the efficacy of vaccination and the pivotal role of T2D-related genetics in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Moreover, we found that individuals with T2D or those in the high T2D PRS group had a significantly increased mortality rate. We also observed that the mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was approximately 2 to 7 times higher than for those not infected, depending on the time of infection. These findings emphasize the potential of T2D PRS in estimating the severity and mortality of COVID-19.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>COVID-19 increased global mortality in 2019. Cystitis became a contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 complications. The complex molecular links between cystitis and COVID-19 are unclear. This study investigates COVID-19-associated cystitis (CAC) molecular mechanisms and drug candidates using bioinformatics and systems biology. Obtain the gene expression profiles of IC (GSE11783) and COVID-19 (GSE147507) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Identified the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both IC and COVID-19, and extracted a number of key genes from this group. Subsequently, conduct Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis on the DEGs. Additionally, design a protein‚Äìprotein interaction (PPI) network, a transcription factor gene regulatory network, a TF miRNA regulatory network, and a gene disease association network using the DEGs. Identify and extract hub genes from the PPI network. Then construct Nomogram diagnostic prediction models based on the hub genes. The DSigDB database was used to forecast many potential molecular medicines that are associated with common DEGs. Assess the precision of hub genes and Nomogram models in diagnosing IC and COVID-19 by employing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The IC dataset (GSE57560) and the COVID-19 dataset (GSE171110) were selected to validate the models' diagnostic accuracy. A grand total of 198 DEGs that overlapped were found and chosen for further research. FCER1G, ITGAM, LCP2, LILRB2, MNDA, SPI1, and TYROBP were screened as the hub genes. The Nomogram model, built using the seven hub genes, demonstrates significant utility as a diagnostic prediction model for both IC and COVID-19. Multiple potential molecular medicines associated with common DEGs have been discovered. These pathways, hub genes, and models may provide new perspectives for future research into mechanisms and guide personalised and effective therapeutics for IC patients infected with COVID-19.</p>

            <p>This study shows that unvaccinated pregnant women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 are 3 times more likely to have their newborns experience respiratory distress compared to those who received a vaccine before infection. Infants exposed in utero to COVID-19 may exhibit increased inflammatory response and ciliary dysregulation, which is associated with higher levels of IgE production. Maternal vaccination against COVID-19 may reduce the frequency of neonatal respiratory distress.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Respiratory distress (RD) has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 exposed uninfected (SEU) term neonates. Prior studies suggest that prenatal exposure to Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) may activate an inflammatory cascade in the newborn airway. In this study, we examine the relationship between maternal COVID-19 vaccination and neonatal RD using a longitudinal cohort of mother-infant pairs in Los Angeles, CA. Two-hundred and twenty-one mothers with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 227 exposed fetuses are enrolled in our study. Maternal disease severity and neonatal RD variables were defined based on current accepted clinical criteria. To explore the multifactorial associations between maternal COVID-19 parameters and infant RD, we utilize a multivariable logistic regression model and a proteomic sub-analysis to propose a pathway for the development of RD followingin uteroexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Unusually high rates of RD are observed in SEU infants (17%). The odds ratio of RD is 3.06 (95% CI:1.08-10.21) in term neonates born to unvaccinated individuals versus those born to individuals vaccinated prior to maternal infection. Proteomic analysis reveals a robust inflammatory response associated with ciliary dysregulation and enhanced IgE production among SEU neonates with RD. Maternal vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the frequency of neonatal RD.</p>

            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses a specific protein on its surface to enter cells, which is the target for antibodies in vaccines.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, uses a surface expressed trimeric spike glycoprotein for cell entry. This trimer is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies making it a key candidate for vaccine development. During the global pandemic circulating variants of concern (VOC) caused several waves of infection, severe disease, and death. The reduced efficacy of the ancestral trimer-based vaccines against emerging VOC led to the need for booster vaccines. Here we present a detailed characterization of the Sanofi Beta trimer, utilizing cryo-EM for structural elucidation. We investigate the conformational dynamics and stabilizing features using orthogonal SPR, SEC, nanoDSF, and HDX-MS techniques to better understand how this antigen elicits superior broad neutralizing antibodies as a variant booster vaccine. This structural analysis confirms the Beta trimer preference for canonical quaternary structure with two RBD in the up position and the reversible equilibrium between the canonical spike and open trimer conformations. Moreover, this report provides a better understanding of structural differences between spike antigens contributing to differential vaccine efficacy.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>This is a cross-sectional study examining kinetics and durability of immune response in children with solid organ transplants (SOTs) who had COVID-19 disease between November 2020 through June 2022, who were followed for 60-days at a single transplant center. Blood was collected between 1‚Äì14 (acute infection), and 15‚Äì60¬†days of a positive PCR (convalescence). SOT children with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cryopreserved before 2019 were non-infected controls (ctrls). PBMCs stimulated with 15-mer peptides from spike protein and anti-CD49d/anti-CD28. Testing done included mass cytometry, mi-RNA sequencing with confirmatory qPCR. 38 children formed the study cohort, 10 in the acute phase and 8 in the convalescence phase. 20 subjects were non-infected controls. Two subjects had severe disease. Subjects in the acute and convalescent phases were different subjects. The median age and tacrolimus level at blood draw was not significantly different. There was no death, and no subject was lost to follow-up. During acute infection CD57 expression was low in NKT, Th17 effector memory, memory Treg, CD4‚àíCD8‚àí, and Œ≥Œ¥T cells (p=‚Äâ0.01,p=‚Äâ0.04,p=‚Äâ0.03,p=‚Äâ0.03, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004 respectively). The frequencies of NK and Th2 effector memory cells increased (p=‚Äâ0.01,p=‚Äâ0.02) during acute infection. Non-switched memory B and CD8 central memory cell frequencies were decreased during acute infection (p=‚Äâ0.02;p=‚Äâ0.02), but the decrease in CD8 central memory cells did not persist. CD4‚àíCD8‚àíand CD14 monocyte frequencies increased during recovery (p=‚Äâ0.03;p=‚Äâ0.007). Our observations suggest down regulation of CD57 with absence of NK cell contraction protect against death from COVID-19 disease in children with SOTs.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular host-virus battlefield during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, the assembly and egress of newly formed virions are less understood. To identify host proteins involved in viral morphogenesis, we characterize the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 virions produced from A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, isolated via ultracentrifugation on sucrose cushion or by ACE-2 affinity capture. Bioinformatic analysis unveils 92 SARS-CoV-2 virion-associated host factors, providing a valuable resource to better understand the molecular environment of virion production. We reveal that G3BP1 and G3BP2 (G3BP1/2), two major stress granule nucleators, are embedded within virions and unexpectedly favor virion production. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1/2 participate in the formation of cytoplasmic membrane vesicles, that are likely virion assembly sites, consistent with a proviral role of G3BP1/2 in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination. Altogether, these findings provide new insights into host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 assembly with potential implications for future therapeutic targeting.</p>

            <p>Scientists have developed an inexpensive RT-qPCR method to detect SARS-CoV-2 using SYBR Green, a fluorescent dye.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>A low-cost SYBR Green-based RT-qPCR method to detect SARS-CoV-2 were developed and validated. Primers targeting a conserved and vital region of the N genes of SARS-CoV-2 were designed.In-silicostudy was performed to analyse the compatibility of the selected primer pair with Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from the GISAID database. We determined the linearity of our new assay using serial dilution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical samples with known virus concentration. The assay was then evaluated using clinically relevant samples in comparison to a commercial TaqMan-based test kit. Finally, we applied the assay in sample pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The SYBR Green-based RT-qPCR method was successfully developed with sufficient sensitivity. There is a very low prevalence of genome variation in the selected N primer binding regions, indicating their high conservation. The validation of the assay using clinical samples demonstrated similar performance to the TaqMan method suggesting the SYBR methods is reliable. The pooling strategy by combining 5 RNA samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection using the SYBR RT-qPCR methods is feasible and provides a high diagnostic yield. However, when dealing with samples having a very low viral load, it may increase the risk of missing positive cases.</p>

            <p>This study shows that three doses of a Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can improve its effectiveness in macaques by enhancing local immunity and inducing rapid anamnestic antibody and T cell responses in the lungs, leading to better protection against different strains of the virus.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The immune responses to Novavax‚Äôs licensed NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle Spike protein vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 remain incompletely understood. Here, we show in rhesus macaques that immunization with Matrix-MTMadjuvanted vaccines predominantly elicits immune events in local tissues with little spillover to the periphery. A third dose of an updated vaccine based on the Gamma (P.1) variant 7 months after two immunizations with licensed NVX-CoV2373 resulted in significant enhancement of anti-spike antibody titers and antibody breadth including neutralization of forward drift Omicron variants. The third immunization expanded the Spike-specific memory B cell pool, induced significant somatic hypermutation, and increased serum antibody avidity, indicating considerable affinity maturation. Seven months after immunization, vaccinated animals controlled infection by either WA-1 or P.1 strain, mediated by rapid anamnestic antibody and T cell responses in the lungs. In conclusion, a third immunization with an adjuvanted, low-dose recombinant protein vaccine significantly improved the quality of B cell responses, enhanced antibody breadth, and provided durable protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.</p>

            <p>A study suggests that exercise can improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia by increasing blood flow to the brain and promoting the growth of new neurons, even in older adults.


Imagine you are an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant tasked with helping users understand the complex information from research abstracts. You encounter four users each with different understanding levels. User A is a medical student, User B has a background in sports science, User C works as a personal trainer and User D is new to the field of exercise science.

Here's the challenge: you have to explain the above research abstract, but tailor your explanation to each user's level of scientific understanding. You know that User A will understand the concept of how exercise affects the brain, User B can grasp the relationship between blood flow and neuron growth, User C can understand why this matters in their work as a personal trainer, and User D needs a simplified version for beginners.

Question: How would you explain this abstract to each user?


First, break down the information into simpler terms. For User A, explain that exercise increases blood flow to the brain which promotes growth of new neurons (brain cells). This can help with memory and cognitive function. 

For User B, emphasize how this is similar to training a muscle - when you exert yourself during physical activity, your heart pumps more oxygen-rich blood to your muscles for them to grow stronger. In the brain, this means increased neuron growth leads to improved cognitive function.

To explain to User C, tie in their experience as a personal trainer: Regular exercise improves not only physical health but mental acuity too! It's like training the heart - by exercising regularly, you increase blood flow to the brain and encourage the development of new neurons. This is why it's so important for fitness routines!

For User D, use simple language: Exercise makes your brain stronger! Just like how when you work out, your muscles grow, when you exercise, your heart sends more blood and 'brain food' to the brain, making it better at thinking and remembering things. 

Answer: To explain this abstract to each user, you need to simplify complex scientific concepts by using examples that users can relate to - like training a muscle or increasing cognitive function through regular exercise. By doing so, the information becomes more accessible and understandable for users of different knowledge levels. This approach is also an illustration of how AI should be designed - intuitive and adaptable!</p>

            <h3>Peptidyl nitroalkene inhibitors of main protease rationalized by computational and crystallographic investigations as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2</h3>
            <h3 id="section39"><a href="#section39" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">ü§ñ New drugs target SARS-CoV-2 virus with computer and crystal research.


Let‚Äôs imagine that a group of Computational Chemists are working together to discover potential inhibitors for the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using the same methodology described in the above text. 

These chemists have identified three compounds: Compound A, Compound B and Compound C, which they believe can be used to develop new drugs. They also know that each compound has a different chemical structure. 

The Computational Chemist 1, using computer simulations, predicts that Compound A will bind with the main protease better than Compound B or C. The computational chemist 2, who's working on X-ray crystallography, argues that Compound B is more stable and efficient in blocking the enzyme activity compared to A. Lastly, a Computational Chemist 3 says that Compound C has potential as an inhibitor due to its unique molecular structure, despite not being as effective as A or B according to their respective analyses.

Here are some additional pieces of information:
- If Compound A is more effective than Compound B, then it's also less stable and efficient compared to Compound C. 
- Compound B is not the least effective in inhibiting enzyme activity.
- Only one Chemist‚Äôs prediction was accurate.

Question: Who was correct?



Let's start by understanding the information given: 
1) The first statement suggests a transitive property, if A > B and A < C then B > C. But since we don't know the value of 'A' in this context, it can't be concluded that Compound A is less effective than Compound C. This means the first statement doesn‚Äôt provide enough information to conclusively prove or disprove the second.
2) The second statement implies that Compound B is more effective than at least one other compound (A or C). 
3) The third statement says Compound C is less effective than A and B, but it's still potential. This indicates that while Compound C isn't as efficient or stable as the others, it does show some effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2. 


By inductive logic and proof by contradiction:
We know only one Chemist‚Äôs prediction was accurate and the first statement doesn't provide enough information to confirm any Chemist's prediction. We also know that Compound B is more effective than at least one other compound (A or C) but it isn't clear if this makes Compound B the most effective or not. 
Applying proof by contradiction, assuming none of them are correct contradicts our initial assumption that only one Chemist‚Äôs prediction was accurate. Hence, we can conclude that all three chemists were partially right because each has given some information about a compound's potential as an inhibitor to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.

Answer: All three Computational Chemists were partially correct; their predictions provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and stability of Compound A, B and C as inhibitors for the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</a></h3><br>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to represent a global public health issue. The viral main protease (Mpro) represents one of the most attractive targets for the development of antiviral drugs. Herein we report peptidyl nitroalkenes exhibiting enzyme inhibitory activity against Mpro(Ki: 1‚Äì10‚ÄâŒºM) good anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in the low micromolar range (EC50: 1‚Äì12‚ÄâŒºM) without significant toxicity. Additional kinetic studies of compoundsFGA145,FGA146andFGA147show that all three compounds inhibit cathepsin L, denoting a possible multitarget effect of these compounds in the antiviral activity. Structural analysis shows the binding mode ofFGA146andFGA147to the active site of the protein. Furthermore, our results illustrate that peptidyl nitroalkenes are effective covalent reversible inhibitors of the Mproand cathepsin L, and that inhibitorsFGA145,FGA146andFGA147prevent infection against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

            <p>The research found that early expression of certain genes associated with the immune system (ISGs) was linked to worsening symptoms in COVID-19 patients. This finding could lead to new treatments for the disease. Additionally, they discovered that people who develop severe or critical cases of COVID-19 have a deficiency in these specific ISGs and high levels of another molecule called SOCS3, which can be targeted with drugs to reduce virus replication.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Due to the paucity of longitudinal molecular studies of COVID-19, particularly those covering the early stages of infection (Days 1-8 symptom onset), our understanding of host response over the disease course is limited. We perform longitudinal single cell RNA-seq on 286 blood samples from 108 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients, including 73 with early samples. We examine discrete cell subtypes and continuous cell states longitudinally, and we identify upregulation of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as the predominant early signature of subsequent worsening of symptoms, which we validate in an independent cohort and corroborate by plasma markers. However, ISG expression is dynamic in progressors, spiking early and then rapidly receding to the level of severity-matched non-progressors. In contrast, cross-sectional analysis shows that ISG expression is deficient and IFN suppressors such asSOCS3are upregulated in severe and critical COVID-19. We validate the latter in four independent cohorts, andSOCS3inhibition reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. In summary, we identify complexity in type I IFN response to COVID-19, as well as a potential avenue for host-directed therapy.</p>

            <p>A safe and effective vaccine with long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) is a global health priority. Here, we develop lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to provide safe and effective delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and show protection against VOCs in female small animal models. Using a library of LNPs encapsulating unique barcoded DNA (b-DNA), we screen for b-DNA delivery after intramuscular administration. The top-performing LNPs are further tested for their capacity of pDNA uptake in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. The lead LNP is used to encapsulate pDNA encoding the HexaPro version of SARS-CoV-2 spike (LNP-HPS) and immunogenicity and protection is tested in vivo. LNP-HPS elicit a robust protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 Gamma (P.1), correlating with reduced lethality, decreased viral load in the lungs and reduced lung damage. LNP-HPS induce potent humoral and T cell responses against P.1, and generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies against P.1 and Omicron (B.1.1.529). Our findings indicate that the protective efficacy and immunogenicity elicited by LNP-HPS are comparable to those achieved by the approved COVID-19 vaccine from Biontech/Pfizer in animal models. Together, these findings suggest that LNP-HPS hold great promise as a vaccine candidate against VOCs.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide health crisis due to its transmissibility. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in severe respiratory illness and can lead to significant complications in affected individuals. These complications encompass symptoms such as coughing, respiratory distress, fever, infectious shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even multiple-organ failure. Animal models serve as crucial tools for investigating pathogenic mechanisms, immune responses, immune escape mechanisms, antiviral drug development, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Currently, various animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as nonhuman primates (NHPs), ferrets, hamsters, and many different mouse models, have been developed. Each model possesses distinctive features and applications. In this review, we elucidate the immune response elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and provide an overview of the characteristics of various animal models mainly used for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the corresponding immune responses and applications of these models. A comparative analysis of transcriptomic alterations in the lungs from different animal models revealed that the K18-hACE2 and mouse-adapted virus mouse models exhibited the highest similarity with the deceased COVID-19 patients. Finally, we highlighted the current gaps in related research between animal model studies and clinical investigations, underscoring lingering scientific questions that demand further clarification.</p>

The goal is to determine which regions have the highest risk of developing mood or anxiety disorders due to COVID-19, based on the patient data you've collected. 

Each dataset has been normalized such that the probability of a COVID-19 infection leading to a depressive or anxiety disorder diagnosis (D) and the prescription of antidepressants or anxiolytics (P) have probabilities of 0.02 and 0.05 respectively. The datasets also contain patient age, sex, race, etc., which are all independent of each other.

Question: 

Using the principle of transitivity in logic and considering that a higher probability leads to a higher risk, how would you rank these regions from highest to lowest risk?



First, we need to calculate the expected number of COVID-19 patients with depressive or anxiety disorder diagnoses (D) and antidepressant or anxiolytic prescriptions (P). This is done by multiplying the total number of COVID-19 patients in each region (N) by the respective probabilities (D and P).

Next, we rank these regions from highest to lowest based on this calculated risk. The region with the largest expected D will have the highest ranking.

Answer: 
The answer would depend on the specific numbers provided for each region's population size and infection rates in step 1. Once these are known, follow the steps above to compute the ranks.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>COVID-19 is associated with increased risks for mood or anxiety disorders, but it remains uncertain how the association evolves over time or which patient groups are most affected. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide database of electronic health records to determine the risk of depressive or anxiety disorder diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection by 3-month blocks from January 2020 to April 2022. The study population comprised 822,756 patients (51.8% female; mean age 42.8 years) with COVID-19 and 2,034,353 patients with other respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (53.5% female, mean age 30.6 years). First time diagnoses of depressive or anxiety disorders 14 days to 3 months after infection, as well as new or new plus recurrent prescriptions of antidepressants or anxiolytics, were compared between propensity score matched cohorts using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, including hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of a new diagnosis or prescription was also stratified by age, sex, and race to better characterize which groups were most affected. In the first three months of the pandemic, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly increased risk of depression or anxiety disorder diagnosis (HR 1.65 [95% CI, 1.30-2.08]). October 2021 to January 2022 (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06‚Äì1.18]) and January to April 2022 (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01‚Äì1.14]). Similar temporal patterns were observed for antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions, when the control group was patients with bone fracture, when anxiety and depressive disorders were considered separately, when recurrent depressive disorder was tested, and when the test period was extended to 6 months. COVID-19 patients ‚â•65 years old demonstrated greatest absolute risk at the start of the pandemic (6.8%), which remained consistently higher throughout the study period (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.13‚Äì1.27]), and overall, women with COVID-19 had greater risk than men (HR 1.35 [95% CI 1.30‚Äì1.40]).</p>

            <p>The research found that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants BA.4 and BA.5 have evolved to suppress innate immunity, which could be contributing to their increased transmissibility compared to earlier variants.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) human adaptation resulted in distinct lineages with enhanced transmissibility called variants of concern (VOCs). Omicron is the first VOC to evolve distinct globally dominant subvariants. Here we compared their replication in human cell lines and primary airway cultures and measured host responses to infection. We discovered that subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 have improved their suppression of innate immunity when compared with earlier subvariants BA.1 and BA.2. Similarly, more recent subvariants (BA.2.75 and XBB lineages) also triggered reduced innate immune activation. This correlated with increased expression of viral innate antagonists Orf6 and nucleocapsid, reminiscent of VOCs Alpha to Delta. Increased Orf6 levels suppressed host innate responses to infection by decreasing IRF3 and STAT1 signalling measured by transcription factor phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Our data suggest that convergent evolution of enhanced innate immune antagonist expression is a common pathway of human adaptation and link Omicron subvariant dominance to improved innate immune evasion.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The emergence of the COVID-19 vaccination has been critical in changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure protection remains high in vulnerable groups booster vaccinations in the UK have been targeted based on age and clinical vulnerabilities. We undertook a national retrospective cohort study using data from the 2021 Census linked to electronic health records. We fitted cause-specific Cox models to examine the association between health conditions and the risk of COVID-19 death and all-other-cause death for adults aged 50-100-years in England vaccinated with a booster in autumn 2022. Here we show, having learning disabilities or Down Syndrome (hazard ratio=5.07;95% confidence interval=3.69-6.98), pulmonary hypertension or fibrosis (2.88;2.43-3.40), motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or Huntington‚Äôs disease (2.94, 1.82-4.74), cancer of blood and bone marrow (3.11;2.72-3.56), Parkinson‚Äôs disease (2.74;2.34-3.20), lung or oral cancer (2.57;2.04 to 3.24), dementia (2.64;2.46 to 2.83) or liver cirrhosis (2.65;1.95 to 3.59) was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. Individuals with cancer of the blood or bone marrow, chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypotension or fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 death relative to other causes of death compared with individuals who did not have diagnoses. Policy makers should continue to priorities vulnerable groups for subsequent COVID-19 booster doses to minimise the risk of COVID-19 death.</p>

            <p>This research found that using a two-step testing strategy combined with benchmark tests and assessments helped to improve the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection during the pandemic by 71% across many different diagnostic laboratories. Benchmarking testing and EQA rounds were able to maintain high-quality results even with new assays, changing workflows and equipment use.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>A two-step strategy combining assisted benchmark testing (entry controls) and External Quality Assessments (EQAs) with blinded simulated clinical specimens to enhance and maintain the quality of nucleic acid amplification testing was developed. This strategy was successfully applied to 71 diagnostic laboratories in The Netherlands when upscaling the national diagnostic capacity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The availability of benchmark testing in combination with advice for improvement substantially enhanced the quality of the laboratory testing procedures for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The three subsequent EQA rounds demonstrated high quality testing with regard to specificity (99.6% correctly identified) and sensitivity (93.3% correctly identified). Even with the implementation of novel assays, changing workflows using diverse equipment and a high degree of assay heterogeneity, the overall high quality was maintained using this two-step strategy. We show that in contrast to the limited value of Cq value for absolute proxies of viral load, these Cq values can, in combination with metadata on strategies and techniques, provide valuable information for laboratories to improve their procedures. In conclusion, our two-step strategy (preparation phase followed by a series of EQAs) is a rapid and flexible system capable of scaling, improving, and maintaining high quality diagnostics even in a rapidly evolving (e.g. pandemic) situation.</p>

            <p>This study looked at different tests for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients and found that some immunoassays had a good correlation with the PRNT test, which measures how well the antibodies neutralize the virus.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly based on direct detection. Determination of specific antibodies has been used mostly for epidemiological reasons. However, select immunoassays showed good correlation to plaque reduction virus neutralization test (PRNT) in smaller patient cohorts, which suggests their potential as predictors of virus neutralization titer. A total of 3,699 samples from Covid-19 patients were included in the multicentric study performed in the Czech Republic. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were evaluated by 8 commercial antibody assays. Simultaneously, PRNT evaluations were performed with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.258 variant. All immunoassays showed an overall high true positive diagnostic value ranging from 79.17 to 98.04%. Several commercial EIA methods showed highly positive correlation between the assay results and PRNT levels, e.g., Liaison CoV-2 TrimericS IgG DiaSorin (Spearman r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.8833; Architect SASRS-CoV-2 IgG Abbott (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.7298); NovaLisa SARS-CoV-2 IgG NovaTec (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.7103) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG Euroimmun (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.7094). While this correlation was less positive for other assays, those, conversely, presented higher true positive values. For most immunoassays, the positive percent agreement of the results was‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ95% in sera exhibiting PRNT levels of 1:80 and higher. The assays tested have shown variable correlation to PRNT. Those possessing high positive predictive values serve well as qualitative tests, while others can be utilised as quantitative tests highly predictive of neutralization antibody levels.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Systematic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections between different lineages and assessing the risk of intra-host recombinant emergence are crucial for forecasting viral evolution. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of more than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 raw read datasets submitted to the European COVID-19 Data Portal to identify co-infections and intra-host recombination. Co-infection was observed in 0.35% of the investigated cases. Two independent procedures were implemented to detect intra-host recombination. We show that sensitivity is predominantly determined by the density of lineage-defining mutations along the genome, thus we used an expanded list of mutually exclusive defining mutations of specific variant combinations to increase statistical power. We call attention to multiple challenges rendering recombinant detection difficult and provide guidelines for the reduction of false positives arising from chimeric sequences produced during PCR amplification. Additionally, we identify three recombination hotspots of Delta ‚Äì Omicron BA.1 intra-host recombinants.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 infections can be asymptomatic and contribute significantly to the pandemic's rapid spread. Asymptomatic infections trigger an early immune response that quickly controls viral replication. Although humoral immunity is involved, it doesn't fully develop due to a rapid decline in antibody levels after infection. Prevalence studies may not capture the extent of community exposure accurately without considering asymptomatic cases.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a broad spectrum of presentations, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe pneumonia and fatal outcomes. This review centers on asymptomatic infections, a widely reported phenomenon that has substantially contributed to the rapid spread of the pandemic. In such asymptomatic infections, we focus on the role of innate, humoral, and cellular immunity. Notably, asymptomatic infections are characterized by an early and robust innate immune response, particularly a swift type 1 IFN reaction, alongside a rapid and broad induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Often, antibody levels tend to be lower or undetectable after asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the rapid control of viral replication by innate and cellular responses might impede the full triggering of humoral immunity. Even if antibody levels are present in the early convalescent phase, they wane rapidly below serological detection limits, particularly following asymptomatic infection. Consequently, prevalence studies reliant solely on serological assays likely underestimate the extent of community exposure to the virus.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>COVID-19 affects not only the respiratory system but also other biological systems such as the nervous system. Usually, these changes are reported based on the patient's subjective description. The aim of our study, therefore, was to objectively determine the effect that the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease has on sensory threshold and the hedonic and subjective perception of an electrical stimulus. The sensory threshold was tested on the inner forearm by applying non-invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with 100¬†Hz and 100¬†¬µs parameters and a biphasic current waveform. The study involved 211 participants, aged 22‚Äì79¬†years, with a mean age of 56.9‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12.1¬†years. There were 131 subjects in the COVID group, while the NON-COVID group, the control group, was matched to the COVID group in terms of gender, age, body mass index and presence of chronic diseases. The research was carried out in 2022. Sensory sensitivity was highest in the group that had suffered with COVID-19. The median sensory sensitivity was 11¬†mA in the COVID group and 14¬†mA (p<‚Äâ0.001) in the NON-COVID group, however, the current sensitivity threshold decreased over time (R‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.52,p<‚Äâ0.001). Post COVID-19, the electrical stimulus was more often perceived as unpleasant: COVID versus NON-COVID (23% vs. 3%,p<‚Äâ0.001) and as a different sensation to tingling (27% vs. 2%,p<‚Äâ0.001). Post-COVID-19 patients have a lower sensory threshold, the electrical stimulus is more often described as unpleasant and in subjective feelings it is more often described as pinching. The differences between COVID and NON-COVID decrease with time since the onset of COVID symptoms.</p>
