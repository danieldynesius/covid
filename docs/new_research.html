                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus is still changing, which means we need to understand how our bodies are responding to it. In this study, scientists used a combination of techniques to see what happens when monkeys are vaccinated with the part of the virus that causes COVID-19 (called the spike protein). They found that the immune cells in the monkeys' bodies were able to evolve and adapt to recognize not just the original form of the spike protein, but also new forms that might appear later. This shows that our bodies have a built-in ability to learn and improve their response to the virus over time.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to understand qualitative aspects of the humoral immune response elicited by spike immunization. Here, we combine monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolation with deep B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing of rhesus macaques immunized with prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein. Longitudinal tracing of spike-sorted B cell lineages in multiple immune compartments demonstrates increasing somatic hypermutation and broad dissemination of vaccine-elicited B cells in draining and non-draining lymphoid compartments, including the bone marrow, spleen and, most notably, periaortic lymph nodes. Phylogenetic analysis of spike-specific monoclonal antibody lineages identified through deep repertoire sequencing delineates extensive intra-clonal diversification that shaped neutralizing activity. Structural analysis of the spike in complex with a broadly neutralizing mAb provides a molecular basis for the observed differences in neutralization breadth between clonally related antibodies. Our findings highlight that immunization leads to extensive intra-clonal B cell evolution where members of the same lineage can both retain the original epitope specificity and evolve to recognize additional spike variants not previously encountered.</p>

                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The effects of long-term COVID-19 on pregnant women and their babies were studied over a year at a hospital in China. Researchers compared 623 pregnant women who had COVID-19 during pregnancy, those who didn't have COVID-19, and some who still had COVID-19 after they gave birth. They found that the women who had long-term COVID-19 were more likely to get high blood pressure during pregnancy (called gestational hypertension) and to develop diabetes during pregnancy (called gestational diabetes mellitus). They also found that their babies might not grow as much inside the womb as other babies did, a condition called fetal intrauterine growth restriction. However, the study didn't find any significant changes in blood clotting or other complications like premature birth or baby problems after birth.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Investigate the effect of long-term COVID-19 on maternal and fetal complications. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 623 pregnant women who delivered in Kunming First People's Hospital from November 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023 were selected. By employing statistical methods, we compared the associations between maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women with acute COVID-19 during pregnancy, long-term COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 pregnant women. In the final 623 samples, there were 209 pregnant women with acute COVID-19, 72 pregnant women with long-term COVID-19, and 342 pregnant women without COVID-19. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all subjects were similar. Pregnant individuals who developed long-term COVID-19 during their pregnancy had an increased risk of experiencing gestational hypertension (OR 3.344, 95% CI 1.544–7.243), gestational diabetes mellitus (OR 2.301, 95% CI 1.290–4.102), and fetal intrauterine growth restriction (OR 2.817, 95% CI 1.385–5.952). Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that this association remained consistent even after adjusting for confounders and performing subgroup analyses. Other maternal and fetal complications, such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, neonatal asphyxia, and transfer of neonates to NICU, did not exhibit statistically significant associations. After linear regression analysis, the platelet count (β: − 0.127, 95% CI − 0.001–0.000) of pregnant women with long-term COVID-19 was slightly lower than that of non-COVID-19 pregnant women, and the other coagulation parameters were not statistically significant. The incidence of gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus and fetal intrauterine growth restriction in pregnant women with long-term COVID-19 is significantly increased, but it does not further increase the coagulation status.</p>

                <p>A safety evaluation of intermittent high-dose inhaled nitric oxide in viral pneumonia due to COVID-19: a randomised clinical study</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>High doses of nitric oxide inhaled into the lungs have been found to help with infections, improve blood flow, and reduce inflammation. This study looked at whether giving high doses of nitric oxide, four times a day for seven days, could help people who were in hospital with viral pneumonia. The researchers compared this treatment to just standard care for 40 adults with viral pneumonia. They found that the treatment group had fewer problems related to breathing and were able to get off oxygen support sooner. Overall, the study suggests that giving high doses of nitric oxide is a safe and helpful way to treat people in hospital with viral pneumonia.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>High-dose inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, vasodilator, and antimicrobial properties, resulting in improved arterial oxygenation as well as a beneficial therapeutic effect on lower respiratory tract infections. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 150-ppm intermittent iNO administered with a novel iNO-generator, for treating adults hospitalised for viral pneumonia. In this prospective, open-label, multicenter study, subjects aged 18–80, diagnosed with viral pneumonia received either standard supportive treatment alone (Control-Group) or combined with iNO for 40 min, 4 times per day up to 7 days (Treatment-Group). Out of 40 recruited subjects, 35 were included in the intention-to-treat population (34 with COVID-19). Adverse Events rate was similar between the groups (56.3% vs. 42.1%; respectively). No treatment-related adverse events were reported, while 2 serious adverse events were accounted for by underlying pre-existing conditions. Among the Treatment-Group, oxygen support duration was reduced by 2.7 days (Hazard Ratio = 2.8; p = 0.0339), a greater number of subjects reached oxygen saturation ≥ 93% within hospitalisation period (Hazard Ratio = 5.4; p = 0.049), and a trend for earlier discharge was demonstrated. Intermittent 150-ppm iNO-treatment is well-tolerated, safe, and beneficial compared to usual care for spontaneously breathing hospitalised adults diagnosed with COVID-19 viral pneumonia.</p>

                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Deep learning and chemistry are being used together to create special nanoparticles that can deliver medicine exactly where it's needed in the body. This is especially helpful for medicines made from a type of genetic material called mRNA. Right now, there's only one kind of nanoparticle that's widely used for mRNA delivery, which is mainly helping with COVID-19 vaccines. But scientists want to develop more types of nanoparticles that can target different cell types in the body. They've created a system called AGILE, which uses computers and chemistry to design and test these special nanoparticles quickly and efficiently. This allows them to find the best nanoparticle for each type of cell, making mRNA therapies even more effective and helping to broaden their use in medicine.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are seeing widespread use in mRNA delivery, notably in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. However, the expansion of mRNA therapies beyond COVID-19 is impeded by the absence of LNPs tailored for diverse cell types. In this study, we present the AI-Guided Ionizable Lipid Engineering (AGILE) platform, a synergistic combination of deep learning and combinatorial chemistry. AGILE streamlines ionizable lipid development with efficient library design, in silico lipid screening via deep neural networks, and adaptability to diverse cell lines. Using AGILE, we rapidly design, synthesize, and evaluate ionizable lipids for mRNA delivery, selecting from a vast library. Intriguingly, AGILE reveals cell-specific preferences for ionizable lipids, indicating tailoring for optimal delivery to varying cell types. These highlight AGILE’s potential in expediting the development of customized LNPs, addressing the complex needs of mRNA delivery in clinical practice, thereby broadening the scope and efficacy of mRNA therapies.</p>

                <p>Title evaluation of FluSight influenza forecasting in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons with a new target laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Accurate predictions can help us prepare for and respond to flu outbreaks more effectively. In 2021 and 2022, a group of scientists made weekly forecasts about how many people would be hospitalized with the flu one to four weeks in advance. They compared their predictions to actual numbers and found that some models were better than others at making accurate forecasts. In fact, an average of all these models (called the FluSight ensemble) was one of the most accurate, but it started to struggle a bit when looking further ahead into the future. This shows that even with multiple models working together, there can be challenges in predicting flu outbreaks, especially during times of rapid change.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Accurate forecasts can enable more effective public health responses during seasonal influenza epidemics. For the 2021–22 and 2022–23 influenza seasons, 26 forecasting teams provided national and jurisdiction-specific probabilistic predictions of weekly confirmed influenza hospital admissions for one-to-four weeks ahead. Forecast skill is evaluated using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), relative WIS, and coverage. Six out of 23 models outperform the baseline model across forecast weeks and locations in 2021–22 and 12 out of 18 models in 2022–23. Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble is the 2ndmost accurate model measured by WIS in 2021–22 and the 5thmost accurate in the 2022–23 season. Forecast skill and 95% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degrade over longer forecast horizons. In this work we demonstrate that while the FluSight ensemble was a robust predictor, even ensembles face challenges during periods of rapid change.</p>

                <p>### ABSTRACT ###

Asthma is a serious breathing problem that affects many people. Before puberty, girls tend to have fewer and less severe symptoms than boys. Scientists wanted to explore if the female sex hormone progesterone (P4) can help reduce inflammation in the lungs of mice with asthma-like symptoms caused by an allergic reaction. They studied two groups of female mice: one group had their ovaries removed to see how it would affect the results.

The scientists collected samples from the mice's blood, lung fluid, and tissues, and analyzed them. They found that P4 treatment helped reduce inflammation in the lungs, decreased mucus production, and reduced the number of immune cells in the lung fluid. It also increased the levels of certain beneficial cells while decreasing those that contribute to inflammation.

P4 was shown to inhibit a process called NETosis, which is linked to inflammation and airway damage. Additionally, it suppressed the activity of an enzyme involved in this process, leading to reduced production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, P4 treatment hindered the release of double-stranded DNA during NETosis.

These findings suggest that P4 may be beneficial in reducing inflammation associated with allergic asthma by modulating the immune microenvironment. The research indicates the potential of P4 as a therapeutic agent for ameliorating inflammation in OVA-induced allergic asthma mice.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Studies have demonstrated that prior to puberty, girls have a lower incidence and severity of asthma symptoms compared to boys. This study aimed to explore the role of progesterone (P4), a sex hormone, in reducing inflammation and altering the immune microenvironment in a mouse model of allergic asthma induced by OVA. Female BALB/c mice with or without ovariectomy to remove the influence of sex hormones were used for the investigations. Serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung tissue samples were collected for analysis. The results indicated that P4 treatment was effective in decreasing inflammation and mucus secretion in the lungs of OVA-induced allergic asthma mice. P4 treatment also reduced the influx of inflammatory cells into the BALF and increased the levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines while decreasing the levels of Th2 and Treg cytokines in both BALF and lung microenvironment CD45+T cells. Furthermore, P4 inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, suppressed NETosis, and reduced the number of pulmonary CD4+T cells while increasing the number of regulatory T cells. The neutrophil elastase inhibitor GW311616A also suppressed airway inflammation and mucus production and modified the secretion of immune Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cytokines in lung CD45+immune cells. These changes led to an alteration of the immunological milieu with increased Th1 and Th17 cells, accompanied by decreased Th2, Treg, and CD44+T cells, similar to the effects of P4 treatment. Treatment with P4 inhibited NETosis by suppressing the p38 pathway activation, leading to reduced reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, P4 treatment hindered the release of double-stranded DNA during NETosis, thereby influencing the immune microenvironment in the lungs. These findings suggest that P4 treatment may be beneficial in reducing inflammation associated with allergic asthma by modulating the immune microenvironment. In conclusion, this research indicates the potential of P4 as a therapeutic agent for ameliorating inflammation in OVA-induced allergic asthma mice.</p>

                <p>Universal subunit vaccine protects against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's an abstract of the article that a young person could understand:

Scientists are trying to find a way to make a special medicine, called a vaccine, that can protect us against many different types of a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus causes COVID-19 and has been making people sick all over the world. The scientists were able to create a few different versions of this vaccine by taking parts from older versions of the virus and putting them together with a new part that they created. They tested these vaccines in mice and found out that one version, called S-6P-Delta-RBD, was very effective at protecting against many different types of the virus, including some that were quite similar to the original virus and others that had changed a lot over time. This vaccine worked so well that it even protected mice who hadn't been vaccinated before when they were challenged with the virus. The scientists think that this vaccine could be used to protect people against all sorts of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, including ones that might come in the future and cause new outbreaks.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Although Omicron RBD of SARS-CoV-2 accumulates many mutations, the backbone region (truncated RBD) of spike protein is highly conserved. Here, we designed several subunit vaccines by keeping the conserved spike backbone region of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 subvariant (S-6P-no-RBD), or inserting the RBD of Delta variant (S-6P-Delta-RBD), Omicron (BA.5) variant (S-6P-BA5-RBD), or ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (S-6P-WT-RBD) to the above backbone construct, and evaluated their ability to induce immune responses and cross-protective efficacy against various SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Among the four subunit vaccines, S-6P-Delta-RBD protein elicited broad and potent neutralizing antibodies against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, the BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.75, BA.4.6, and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, and the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine prevented infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, and completely protected immunized mice against lethal challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and SARS-CoV. Sera from S-6P-Delta-RBD-immunized mice protected naive mice against challenge with the Delta variant, with significantly reduced viral titers and without pathological effects. Protection correlated positively with the serum neutralizing antibody titer. Overall, the designed vaccine has potential for development as a universal COVID-19 vaccine and/or a pan-sarbecovirus subunit vaccine that will prevent current and future outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-related CoVs.</p>

                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Evolution of COVID-19 virus mutations highlights the need for vaccines that can protect against multiple strains at once. A new vaccine, SCTV01E, has been developed to target four different versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1. In a large-scale study, 9,223 participants were randomly divided into two groups: one received SCTV01E, while the other got a placebo. The results showed that SCTV01E was effective in preventing COVID-19, with a success rate of 69.4%. It also provided strong protection against all SARS-CoV-2 infections (79.7% and 82.4% at 14 days post-vaccination). Additionally, SCTV01E elicited a significantly higher immune response against the Omicron BA.5 variant compared to the placebo group. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events or deaths reported. These findings suggest that SCTV01E could be an effective vaccine alternative against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants emphasizes the need for multivalent vaccines capable of simultaneously targeting multiple strains. SCTV01E is a tetravalent COVID-19 vaccine derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1. In this double-blinded placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy trial (NCT05308576), the primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against COVID-19 seven days post-vaccination in individuals without recent infection. Other endpoints included evaluating safety, immunogenicity, and the VE against all SARS-CoV-2 infections in individuals meeting the study criteria. Between December 26, 2022, and January 15, 2023, 9,223 individuals were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive SCTV01E or a placebo. SCTV01E showed a VE of 69.4% (95% CI: 50.6, 81.0) 7 days post-vaccination, with 75 cases in the placebo group and 23 in the SCTV01E group for the primary endpoint. VEs were 79.7% (95% CI: 51.0, 91.6) and 82.4% (95% CI: 57.9, 92.6), respectively, for preventing symptomatic infection and all SARS-CoV-2 infections 14 days post-vaccination. SCTV01E elicited a 25.0-fold higher neutralizing antibody response against Omicron BA.5 28 days post-vaccination compared to placebo. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient, with no reported vaccine-related SAE, adverse events of special interest (AESI), or deaths. The trial aligned with the shift from dominant variants BA.5 and BF.7 to XBB, suggesting SCTV01E as a potential vaccine alternative effective against present and future variants.</p>

                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>People who have had COVID-19 for a long time often get dizzy or faint when they stand up, but we don't know why this happens. To learn more, we studied 688 people who came to our clinic with long COVID and were suspected of having this problem. We tested them while they stood still for 10 minutes to see how their bodies reacted. In 33 out of the 86 people we tested, their body reacted strongly when they stood up - they got nausea (feeling sick to their stomach) and their heart beat faster than usual. When they stood up, their blood pressure also went up more in these 33 people compared to those who didn't react strongly. We found that older people with this problem had higher levels of a hormone called cortisol, while younger people had lower levels of another hormone called growth hormone. These changes might help us diagnose the cause of dizziness and fainting in people with long COVID.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a key symptom of long COVID; however, the pathophysiology remains unknown. Among 688 long COVID patients who visited our clinic during the period from February 2021 to April 2023, 86 patients who were suspected of having OI and who underwent an active standing test (ST) were investigated to elucidate the clinical characteristics of OI in patients with long COVID. Of the 86 patients, 33 patients (38%) were ST-positive. Nausea and tachycardia in daily life were frequent complaints in the ST-positive group. The increase in heart rate (HR) during the ST was significantly greater during a 10-min period after standing in the ST-positive group (+ 30 bpm) than in the ST-negative group (+ 16 bpm). The initial increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) just after standing was significantly greater in the ST-positive group (+ 14 mmHg) than in the ST-negative group (+ 9 mmHg). Serum cortisol levels in the ST-positive patients aged over 20 years were higher and growth hormone levels in the patients under 20 years of age were lower than those in the ST-negative group. Autonomous nervous symptoms, transient DBP rise with increasing HR after standing, and endocrine dysfunctions are helpful for detecting OI related to long COVID.</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and many people are getting less protected against severe illness as time goes on. To keep everyone safe, it's essential to have access to affordable vaccines globally. Researchers created a new version of the virus that causes COVID-19, which they adapted to grow in a special cell culture. This new virus grew much faster and produced 50 times more vaccine material than the original version. Despite this change, the new virus still allowed our immune system to recognize and fight it off just like the original one. Studies showed that vaccines made from this new virus were effective against different COVID-19 variants and even protected animals from getting sick when they were exposed to these viruses. This suggests that adapting the virus to grow in cell culture could be a useful way to produce more vaccine, making it easier for people around the world to get protected against COVID-19.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Rapidly waning immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires continued global access to affordable vaccines. Globally, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been widely used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this proof-of-concept study we adapted an original-D614G SARS-CoV-2 virus to Vero cell culture as a strategy to enhance inactivated vaccine manufacturing productivity. A passage 60 (P60) virus showed enhanced fitness and 50-fold increased virus yield in a bioreactor compared to the original-D614G virus. It further remained susceptible to neutralization by plasma from SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated and convalescent individuals, suggesting exposure of relevant epitopes. Monovalent inactivated P60 and bivalent inactivated P60/omicron BA.1 vaccines induced neutralizing responses against original-D614G and BA.1 viruses in mice and hamsters, demonstrating that the P60 virus is a suitable vaccine antigen. Antibodies further cross-neutralized delta and BA.5 viruses. Importantly, the inactivated P60 vaccine protected hamsters against disease upon challenge with original-D614G or BA.1 virus, with minimal lung pathology and lower virus loads in the upper and lower airways. Antigenicity of the P60 virus was thus retained compared to the original virus despite the acquisition of cell culture adaptive mutations. Consequently, cell culture adaptation may be a useful approach to increase yields in inactivated vaccine antigen production.</p>

                <p>### ABSTRACT
Imagine a special protein called Papain-like protease (PLpro) that helps the SARS-CoV-2 virus multiply inside cells. This protein is crucial for the virus's survival, and scientists are interested in it as a potential target for new medicines.

To better understand PLpro, researchers used a powerful tool to scan millions of tiny changes in its genetic code and see how these changes affect the protein's ability to function properly within human cells. They discovered that some parts of the protein are very sensitive to even small changes, while others can tolerate more significant modifications without losing their job.

The study also found that specific areas around the protein's active site (where it does its main work) and a flexible loop (that helps it move and interact with other molecules) play crucial roles in how well PLpro works. Furthermore, the researchers noticed that changes to one part of the protein can indirectly affect its overall activity by influencing how it interacts with other molecules.

Using this knowledge, scientists were able to identify new versions of PLpro that might be resistant to a common inhibitor (a type of drug that stops or slows down the protein's function). This discovery is important because it suggests that when designing drugs against PLpro, scientists should consider not only the active site but also other flexible parts of the protein.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-2 because it is essential for viral replication, cleaving viral poly-proteins pp1a and pp1ab, and has de-ubiquitylation and de-ISGylation activities, affecting innate immune responses. We employ Deep Mutational Scanning to evaluate the mutational effects on PLpro enzymatic activity and protein stability in mammalian cells. We confirm features of the active site and identify mutations in neighboring residues that alter activity. We characterize residues responsible for substrate binding and demonstrate that although residues in the blocking loop are remarkably tolerant to mutation, blocking loop flexibility is important for function. We additionally find a connected network of mutations affecting activity that extends far from the active site. We leverage our library to identify drug-escape variants to a common PLpro inhibitor scaffold and predict that plasticity in both the S4 pocket and blocking loop sequence should be considered during the drug design process.</p>

                <p>Multi-antigen intranasal vaccine protects against challenge with sarbecoviruses and prevents transmission in hamsters</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Immunization programs that protect people from getting sick with SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be effective, but they are not always good at preventing people from getting infected. Mucosal (surface-related) vaccines may provide better protection against the spread of the virus and could potentially work well even if new variants or related viruses emerge. Here, we tested a multi-component intranasal vaccine called NanoSTING-SN that targets different parts of SARS-CoV-2 and found it to be very effective in preventing the virus from replicating in both the lungs and nasal passages when challenged with the Delta variant. We also showed that this vaccine prevents transmission of another SARS-CoV-2 variant (Omicron) to unvaccinated animals. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NanoSTING-SN protects against SARS-CoV, a different virus related to SARS-CoV-2, by showing that immunized mice did not lose weight and all survived the infection. In non-human primates, the vaccine elicited long-lasting (up to 6 months) serum IgG responses and nasal wash IgA responses that could protect against other viruses like XBB1.5 (another SARS-CoV-2 variant), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. This has two implications: (1) mucosal multi-component vaccines may help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, and (2) eliciting immunity to multiple antigens could be beneficial in developing pan-sarbecovirus vaccines that protect against a wide range of related viruses.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Immunization programs against SARS-CoV-2 with commercial intramuscular vaccines prevent disease but are less efficient in preventing infections. Mucosal vaccines can provide improved protection against transmission, ideally for different variants of concern (VOCs) and related sarbecoviruses. Here, we report a multi-antigen, intranasal vaccine, NanoSTING-SN (NanoSTING-Spike-Nucleocapsid), eliminates virus replication in both the lungs and the nostrils upon challenge with the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC. We further demonstrate that NanoSTING-SN prevents transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC (BA.5) to vaccine-naïve hamsters. To evaluate protection against other sarbecoviruses, we immunized mice with NanoSTING-SN. We showed that immunization affords protection against SARS-CoV, leading to protection from weight loss and 100% survival in mice. In non-human primates, animals immunized with NanoSTING-SN show durable serum IgG responses (6 months) and nasal wash IgA responses cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 (XBB1.5), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV antigens. These observations have two implications: (1) mucosal multi-antigen vaccines present a pathway to reducing transmission of respiratory viruses, and (2) eliciting immunity against multiple antigens can be advantageous in engineering pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.</p>

                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 is a serious illness that can cause the blood to become very "sticky" and prone to clotting. Our goal was to see if removing these "stickier" parts from the blood could help reduce this problem. We also wanted to know if it would make things better or worse for patients with severe COVID-19 who were having trouble breathing. We looked at 22 people who needed extra oxygen or a machine to help them breathe, and randomly assigned them either to get the special treatment (called plasma exchange) or to just get their usual care. After a few days, we found that the plasma exchange did reduce some of the bad stuff in the blood that can cause clotting, but it didn't seem to make things better for people who were having trouble breathing or getting more clots.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 disease is associated with a hyperinflammatory, pro-thrombotic state and a high mortality. Our primary objective was to assess the change in inflammatory and thrombotic markers associated with PEX, and secondary objectives were to assess the effects of PEX on progression of respiratory failure and incidence of acute thrombotic events. We conducted a prospective, phase II, non-blinded randomised control trial of plasma exchange compared to standard of care in critically ill adults with severe COVID-19 associated respiratory failure, requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support and elevated thrombo-inflammatory markers (LDH, CRP, ferritin, and D-Dimer). Patients randomised to receive PEX were treated with a daily single volume plasma exchange for a minimum of five days. Twenty-two patients were randomised of who 11 received PEX. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups at presentation. PEX was associated with a significant reduction in pro-thrombotic markers FVIII, VWF and VWF Ag: ADAMTS 13 ratio (p< 0.001). There were no differences in the reduction of inflammatory markers, severity of respiratory failure (p= 0.7), thrombotic events (p= 0.67), or mortality (p> 0.99) at 28 days. PEX successfully reduced pro-thrombotic markers, although was not associated with reduction in inflammatory markers, respiratory failure, or thrombotic events.Trial registration: (NCT04623255); first posted on 10/11/2020.</p>

                <p>Inflammation in the COVID-19 airway is due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>In people with COVID-19, the virus causes an overactive immune response that can lead to sickness and death. This happens because the virus activates certain cells in the airways that normally help fight off infections. Researchers have also found that a similar overactive immune response is seen in people with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that affects the airways.

The researchers wanted to know if the COVID-19 virus might be causing inflammation in the airways of people with COVID-19 by blocking a protein called CFTR. They used an artificial model of normal airway cells and found that exposing these cells to the COVID-19 spike protein led to the loss of CFTR function.

The researchers also showed that blocking the interaction between the COVID-19 spike protein and another protein called ACE2 prevented the loss of CFTR function. Furthermore, they found that the COVID-19 virus itself caused a loss of CFTR protein in airway cells, but this was rescued by blocking the interaction between the spike protein and ACE2.

Overall, these findings suggest that inflammation in the airways of people with COVID-19 may be due to the inhibition of CFTR signaling by the COVID-19 spike protein, leading to a cystic fibrosis-like clinical phenotype.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2-contributes to sickness and death in COVID-19 patients partly by inducing a hyper-proinflammatory immune response in the host airway. This hyper-proinflammatory state involves activation of signaling by NFκB, and unexpectedly, ENaC, the epithelial sodium channel. Post-infection inflammation may also contribute to "Long COVID"/PASC. Enhanced signaling by NFκB and ENaC also marks the airway of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a life-limiting proinflammatory genetic disease due to inactivating mutations in the CFTR gene. We therefore hypothesized that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway might similarly be due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and therefore activation of both NFκB and ENaC signaling. We used western blot and electrophysiological techniques, and an organoid model of normal airway epithelia, differentiated on an air–liquid-interface (ALI). We found that CFTR protein expression and CFTR cAMP-activated chloride channel activity were lost when the model epithelium was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. As hypothesized, the absence of CFTR led to activation of both TNFα/NFκB signaling and α and γ ENaC. We had previously shown that the cardiac glycoside drugs digoxin, digitoxin and ouabain blocked interaction of spike protein and ACE2. Consistently, addition of 30 nM concentrations of the cardiac glycoside drugs, prevented loss of both CFTR protein and CFTR channel activity. ACE2 and CFTR were found to co-immunoprecipitate in both basal cells and differentiated epithelia. Thus spike-dependent CFTR loss might involve ACE2 as a bridge between Spike and CFTR. In addition, spike exposure to the epithelia resulted in failure of endosomal recycling to return CFTR to the plasma membrane. Thus, failure of CFTR recovery from endosomal recycling might be a mechanism for spike-dependent loss of CFTR. Finally, we found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection induced loss of CFTR protein, which was rescued by the cardiac glycoside drugs digitoxin and ouabain. Based on experiments with this organoid model of small airway epithelia, and comparisons with 16HBE14o- and other cell types expressing normal CFTR, we predict that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway may be mediated by inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus inducing a cystic fibrosis-like clinical phenotype. To our knowledge this is the first time COVID-19 airway inflammation has been experimentally traced in normal subjects to a contribution from SARS-CoV-2 spike-dependent inhibition of CFTR signaling.</p>

                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Two key things that can affect how quickly the coronavirus makes people sick are: 1) how well the virus's spike protein fits onto a special receptor on human cells called ACE2, and 2) how flexible the outer membrane of those cells is. This study wanted to see if a strong magnetic field could change either of these two things. They tested it on a type of lung cell in a lab dish (called Calu-3 cells) and also on mice. The results showed that a strong magnetic field can make the spike protein bind less well to ACE2 receptors, and it can also make the outer membrane of lung cells more flexible. This might be helpful for finding new ways to treat people with COVID-19 without having to touch or insert anything into their lungs.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Two important factors affecting the progress of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the S-protein binding function of ACE2 receptors and the membrane fluidity of host cells. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of static magnetic field (SMF) on S-protein/ACE2 binding and cellular membrane fluidity of lung cells, and was performed in vitro using a Calu-3 cell model and in vivo using an animal model. The ability of ACE2 receptors to bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on host cell surfaces under SMF stimulation was evaluated using fluorescence images. Host lung cell membrane fluidity was tested using fluorescence polarization to determine the effects of SMF. Our results indicate that 0.4 T SMF can affect binding between S-protein and ACE2 receptors and increase Calu-3 cell membrane fluidity, and that SMF exposure attenuates LPS-induced alveolar wall thickening in mice. These results may be of value for developing future non-contact, non-invasive, and low side-effect treatments to reduce disease severity in COVID-19-invaded lungs.</p>

                <p>In people who got vaccinated and then got infected with COVID-19, we found out that their nerves in the front part of their eye (called the cornea) were healthier than those in people who didn't get vaccinated but still got infected. We compared these two groups to a group of people who weren't sick with COVID-19. The good news is that the vaccinated group had stronger and longer nerves, which could help protect them from complications related to COVID-19. However, we also found out that people who didn't get vaccinated had more immune cells (called dendritic cells) in their eyes than healthy individuals. This might be a sign of how the body responds differently when it's not protected by vaccines. Our study suggests that getting vaccinated might help keep the nerves in your eye safe from damage during a COVID-19 infection.</p><br>

                <p>To examine corneal subbasal nerve changes in patients who received vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus and underwent COVID-19 infection compared to infected non-vaccinated patients and healthy controls. Twenty-nine eyes of 29 vaccinated patients (mean age: 36.66 ± 12.25 years) within six months after PCR or Ag test proven COVID-19 infection and twenty-eight eyes of 28 age-matched infected, non-vaccinated patients (mean age: 42.14 ± 14.17 years) were enrolled. Twenty-five age-matched healthy individuals (mean age: 47.52 ± 18.45 years) served as controls. In vivo confocal microscopy (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II Rostock Cornea Module, Germany) was performed in each group. Corneal subbasal nerve plexus morphology and corneal dendritic cells (DC) were evaluated. Significantly higher corneal nerve fiber density (P < 0.001), nerve branch density (P < 0.001), nerve fiber length (P < 0.001), total branch density (P = 0.007), nerve fiber area (P = 0.001) and fractal dimension (P < 0.001) values were observed in vaccinated patients after COVID-19 infection compared to the non-vaccinated group. Significantly higher DC density was observed in the non-vaccinated group compared to the control group (P = 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the size of mature DCs (P < 0.0001) but the size of immature DCs did not differ significantly among the 3 groups (P = 0.132). Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may have a protective effect against the complications of COVID-19 disease on the corneal subbasal nerve fibers.</p>

                <p>Genomic surveillance and vaccine response to the dominant SARS-CoV-2 XBB lineage in Rio Grande do Sul</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging to control due to new types of viruses emerging, making it hard for vaccines and treatments to work effectively. One of these variants, called XBB, has shown that it can spread quickly without causing severe illness, but still poses a threat to people's health. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, researchers looked at 746 samples from COVID-19 patients between 2022 and 2023. They found that by March 2023, XBB was the most common variant, making up about 83% of all cases. Most people who got infected with XBB were able to recover quickly, but a small percentage (about 2%) died from the infection. Interestingly, even those who had received three vaccine doses and had previously been infected with COVID-19 could get reinfected with XBB, with about 59% of these cases occurring in people whose last vaccine dose was over a year ago. This might be because their immune system's protection had worn off. The researchers also identified 90 mutations within the XBB variant that were spread across its genome and included changes to the part of the virus that makes it hard for the body to fight back. This study provides important insights into how the XBB variant took over in this region, and continued monitoring of the virus's evolution is crucial for effective public health management.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been marked by novel viral variants, posing challenges to global public health. Recombination, a viral evolution mechanism, is implicated in SARS-CoV-2's ongoing evolution. The XBB recombinant lineage, known for evading antibody-mediated immunity, exhibits higher transmissibility without increased disease severity. We investigated the prevalence and genomic features of XBB in SARS-CoV-2-positive cases in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. We sequenced 357 samples from epidemiological weeks (EW) 47/2022 to 17/2023, and included 389 publicly available sequences. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from DATASUS, e-SUS, and SIVEP GRIPE (data recording systems of the Brazilian Ministry of Health). Of these, 143 were classified as XBB and 586 were other Omicron lineages. In March 2023 (EW 10), XBB became dominant, accounting for 83.3% of cases. 97.7% of XBB-infected patients successfully recovered from the infection, with a low mortality rate (2.3%). Even after receiving three vaccine doses and having been previously infected, 59.5% of the patients experienced reinfection with XBB. However, for 54% of the individuals, the interval between their XBB infection and the last vaccine dose exceeded one year, potentially leading to a decline in antibody levels. In addition, we identified 90 mutations in RS circulating XBB, spread throughout the genome, notably in the Spike protein region associated with immune resistance. This study provides insights into the dynamics and impact of a recombinant variant becoming predominant for the first time in the state. Continued surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomic evolution is crucial for effective public health management.</p>

                <p>Intranasal adenovirus-vectored Omicron vaccine induced nasal immunoglobulin A has superior neutralizing potency than serum antibodies</p><br>
                <p>🤖 <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The upper part of our respiratory system is where COVID-19 starts to take hold in the body. A special type of antibody called secretory IgA (sIgA) has been shown to protect against breakthrough infections from new COVID-19 variants, like Omicron. We found that a vaccine given directly into the nose using a harmless virus as a delivery system can stimulate the production of robust sIgA in the nasal passages. This sIgA was mainly made up of two or more identical units and accounted for about 40% of all proteins in the mucus lining the nasal passage. We also detected a small amount of another type of antibody, IgG, but not IgM, IgD, or IgE. After rinsing the nose with a saline solution, sIgA levels in the nasal passage were quickly replenished within just a few hours. Comparing sIgA in the nasal passages to antibodies in the blood, we found that sIgA was up to 3-logs more effective at binding to and neutralizing new COVID-19 variants. In contrast, blood antibodies failed to neutralize two newly emerged variants, XBB and BA.2.86, but sIgA still retained its ability to neutralize these variants. Furthermore, we discovered that sIgA was better than IgG or IgA at blocking the spread of COVID-19 between cells and protecting mice from a challenge with the XBB variant. By estimating the percentage of spike-specific sIgA in nasal mucus collected one month after intranasal vaccination, we found it to be around 2.6-3.9%. Our study provides insights for developing nose-sprayed vaccines that can stimulate the production of sIgA and build an effective first-line defense against emerging COVID-19 variants.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The upper respiratory tract is the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasal spike-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) correlates with protection against Omicron breakthrough infection. We report that intranasal vaccination using human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vectored Omicron spike in people who previously vaccinated with ancestral vaccine could induce robust neutralizing sIgA in the nasal passage. Nasal sIgA was predominantly present in dimeric and multimeric forms and accounted for nearly 40% of total proteins in nasal mucosal lining fluids (NMLFs). A low-level IgG could also be detected in NMLFs but not IgM, IgD, and IgE. After a complete nasal wash, sIgA in the nasal passage could be replenished rapidly within a few hours. A comparison of purified paired serum IgA, serum IgG, and nasal sIgA from the same individuals showed that sIgA was up to 3-logs more potent than serum antibodies in binding to spikes and in neutralizing Omicron subvariants. Serum IgG and IgA failed to neutralize XBB and BA.2.86, while nasal sIgA retained potent neutralization against these newly emerged variants. Further analysis showed that sIgA was more effective than IgG or IgA in blocking spike-mediated cell-to-cell transmission and protecting hACE2 mice from XBB challenge. Using a sIgA monoclonal antibody as a reference, we estimated that the total nasal sIgA contains about 2.6–3.9% spike-specific sIgA in NMLFs collected approximately one month after intranasal vaccination. Our study provided insights for developing intranasal vaccines that can induce sIgA to build an effective and mutation-resistant first-line immune barrier against constantly emerging variants.</p>
