            <p>This review investigates a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and autoimmune-driven neuropsychiatric manifestations involving NMDA receptors, but finds no significant evidence to support such a connection, emphasizing the need for continued research.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The global impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection has raised concerns about secondary diseases beyond acute illness. This review explores the significance and potential underlying mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 infection might elicit an immune response targeting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and its implications for autoimmune-driven neuropsychiatric manifestations. We identified 19 published case reports of NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination by a systematic literature search. The significance of these reports was limited since it is not clear if a coincidental or causal relationship exists between SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and manifestation of NMDA receptor encephalitis. The included studies were hampered by difficulties in establishing if these patients had pre-existing NMDA receptor antibodies which entered the brain by infection- or vaccination-associated transient blood-brain barrier leakage. In addition, four cases had comorbid ovarian teratoma, which is a known trigger for development of NMDA receptor encephalitis. Considering that billions of people have contracted COVID-19 or have been vaccinated against this virus, the publication of only 19 case reports with a possible link to NMDA receptor encephalitis, indicates that it is rare. In conclusion, these findings do not support the case that SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination led to an increase of existing or de novo encephalitis mediated by an autoimmune response targeting NMDA receptor function. Nevertheless, this work underscores the importance of ongoing vigilance in monitoring viral outbreaks and their potential impact on the central nervous system through basic, epidemiological and translational research.</p>

            <p>This study found that a larger proportion of people in Bangalore, India had cellular immunity to COVID than humoral immunity, and low socio-economic status communities displayed higher frequency of cellular immunity due to greater exposure to infection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Two types of immunity, humoral and cellular, offer protection against COVID. Humoral protection, contributed by circulating neutralizing antibodies, can provide immediate protection but decays more quickly than cellular immunity and can lose effectiveness in the face of mutation and drift in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Therefore, population-level seroprevalence surveys used to estimate population-level immunity may underestimate the degree to which a population is protected against COVID. In early 2021, before India began its vaccination campaign, we tested for humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-Cov-2 in representative samples of slum and non-slum populations in Bangalore, India. We found that 29.7% of samples (unweighted) had IgG antibodies to the spike protein and 15.5% had neutralizing antibodies, but at up to 46% showed evidence of cellular immunity. We also find that prevalence of cellular immunity is significantly higher in slums than in non-slums. These findings suggest (1) that a significantly larger proportion of the population in Bangalore, India, had cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 than had humoral immunity, as measured by serological surveys, and (2) that low socio-economic status communities display higher frequency of cellular immunity, likely because of greater exposure to infection due to population density.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This research explores the design and characterization of various stability levels of spike proteins, finding that a highly stable spike protein with exposed conserved epitopes may be necessary to increase immunogenicity in future COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 induces neutralizing antibodies and is the key component of current COVID-19 vaccines. The most efficacious COVID-19 vaccines are genetically-encoded spikes with a double proline substitution in the hinge region to stabilize S in the prefusion conformation (S-2P). A subunit vaccine can be a valuable addition to mRNA and viral vector-based vaccines but requires high stability of spike. In addition, further stabilization of the prefusion conformation of spike might improve immunogenicity. To test this, five spike proteins were designed and characterized, ranging from low to high stability. The immunogenicity of these proteins was assessed in mice, demonstrating that a spike (S-closed-2) with a high melting temperature, which still allowed ACE2 binding, induced the highest neutralization titers against homologous and heterologous strains (up to 16-fold higher than the least stabilized spike). In contrast, the most stable spike variant (S-locked), in which the receptor binding domains (RBDs) were locked in a closed conformation and thus not able to breathe, induced relatively low neutralizing antibody titers against heterologous strains. These data demonstrate that S protein stabilization with RBDs exposing highly conserved epitopes may be needed to increase the immunogenicity of spike proteins for future COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This research found that specific innate sensors influence the activation or differentiation of monocytes in response to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, potentially contributing to the severity of COVID-19; these findings may help understand immunopathology and identify therapeutic targets.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Increased recruitment of transitional and non-classical monocytes in the lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with COVID-19 severity. However, whether specific innate sensors mediate the activation or differentiation of monocytes in response to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 but not nucleoprotein induce differentiation of monocytes into transitional or non-classical subsets from both peripheral blood and COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples in a NFŒ∫B-dependent manner, but this process does not require inflammasome activation. However, NLRP3 and NLRC4 differentially regulated CD86 expression in monocytes in response to Spike 1 and Nucleoprotein, respectively. Moreover, monocytes exposed to Spike 1 induce significantly higher proportions of Th1 and Th17 CD4‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cells. In contrast, monocytes exposed to Nucleoprotein reduce the degranulation of CD8‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cells from severe COVID-19 patients. Our study provides insights in the differential impact of innate sensors in regulating monocytes in response to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which might be useful to better understand COVID-19 immunopathology and identify therapeutic targets.</p>

            <p>This study developed a novel screening platform using gold nanoparticles to rapidly identify effective antiviral therapies targeting the main protease (Mpro) in SARS-CoV-2, which may help accelerate the discovery of treatments against COVID-19 and its variants.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evoked a worldwide pandemic. As the emergence of variants has hampered the neutralization capacity of currently available vaccines, developing effective antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants becomes a significant challenge. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 has received increased attention as an attractive pharmaceutical target because of its pivotal role in viral replication and proliferation. Here, we generated a de novo Mpro-inhibitor screening platform to evaluate the efficacies of Mproinhibitors based on Mprocleavage site-embedded amyloid peptide (MCAP)-coated gold nanoparticles (MCAP-AuNPs). We fabricated MCAPs comprising an amyloid-forming sequence and Mpro-cleavage sequence, mimicking in vivo viral replication process mediated by Mpro. By measuring the proteolytic activity of Mproand the inhibitory efficacies of various drugs, we confirmed that the MCAP-AuNP-based platform was suitable for rapid screening potential of Mproinhibitors. These results demonstrated that our MCAP-AuNP-based platform has great potential for discovering Mproinhibitors and may accelerate the development of therapeutics against COVID-19.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The development of a vaccine specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Omicron has been hampered due to its low immunogenicity. Here, using reverse mutagenesis, we found that a phenylalanine-to-serine mutation at position 375 (F375S) in the spike protein of Omicron to revert it to the sequence found in Delta and other ancestral strains significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of Omicron vaccines. Sequence FAPFFAF at position 371‚Äì377 in Omicron spike had a potent inhibitory effect on macrophage uptake of receptor-binding domain (RBD) nanoparticles or spike-pseudovirus particles containing this sequence. Omicron RBD enhanced binding to Siglec-9 on macrophages to impair phagocytosis and antigen presentation and promote immune evasion, which could be abrogated by the F375S mutation. A bivalent F375S Omicron RBD and Delta-RBD nanoparticle vaccine elicited potent and broad nAbs in mice, rabbits and rhesus macaques. Our research suggested that manipulation of the Siglec-9 pathway could be a promising approach to enhance vaccine response.</p>

            <p>Wastewater surveillance is a cost-effective tool for monitoring community health, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and this study presents time series methods coupled with statistical process control to analyze wastewater data over time, helping public health decisions by identifying potential outbreaks.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Wastewater surveillance has proven a cost-effective key public health tool to understand a wide range of community health diseases and has been a strong source of information on community levels and spread for health departments throughout the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic. Studies spanning the globe demonstrate the strong association between virus levels observed in wastewater and quality clinical case information of the population served by the sewershed. Few of these studies incorporate the temporal dependence present in sampling over time, which can lead to estimation issues which in turn impact conclusions. We contribute to the literature for this important public health science by putting forward time series methods coupled with statistical process control that (1) capture the evolving trend of a disease in the population; (2) separate the uncertainty in the population disease trend from the uncertainty due to sampling and measurement; and (3) support comparison of sub-sewershed population disease dynamics with those of the population represented by the larger downstream treatment plant. Our statistical methods incorporate the fact that measurements are over time, ensuring correct statistical conclusions. We provide a retrospective example of how sub-sewersheds virus levels compare to the upstream wastewater treatment plant virus levels. An on-line algorithm supports real-time statistical assessment of deviations of virus level in a population represented by a sub-sewershed to the virus level in the corresponding larger downstream wastewater treatment plant. This information supports public health decisions by spotlighting segments of the population where outbreaks may be occurring.</p>

            <p>This study investigated the use of different lipid and polymeric-based nanoparticle prototypes to deliver mRNA encoding a trimeric soluble receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, finding that modified lipid nanoparticles (mLNP) and classical lipid nanoparticles (LNP-1) were the most effective at inducing antibodies against the virus and fully protecting mice from infection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Vaccines based on mRNA technology have revolutionized the field. In fact, lipid nanoparticles (LNP) formulated with mRNA are the preferential vaccine platform used in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, with wider application against other diseases. The high demand and property right protection of the most potent cationic/ionizable lipids used for LNP formulation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have promoted the design of alternative nanocarriers for nucleic acid delivery. In this study we have evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of different rationally designed lipid and polymeric-based nanoparticle prototypes against SARS-CoV-2 infection. An mRNA coding for a trimeric soluble form of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein from SARS-CoV-2 was encapsulated using different components to form nanoemulsions (NE), nanocapsules (NC) and lipid nanoparticles (LNP). The toxicity and biological activity of these prototypes were evaluated in cultured cells after transfection and in mice following homologous prime/boost immunization. Our findings reveal good levels of RBD protein expression with most of the formulations. In C57BL/6 mice immunized intramuscularly with two doses of formulated RBD-mRNA, the modified lipid nanoparticle (mLNP) and the classical lipid nanoparticle (LNP-1) were the most effective delivery nanocarriers at inducing binding and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Both prototypes fully protected susceptible K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from morbidity and mortality following a SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These results highlight that modulation of mRNAs immunogenicity can be achieved by using alternative nanocarriers and support further assessment of mLNP and LNP-1 prototypes as delivery vehicles for mRNA vaccines.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This study reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein disrupts the Rab7 GTP hydrolysis cycle, leading to hyperactivation of late endolysosomal and lysosomal pathways, benefiting viral replication while impairing biosynthetic transport of hydrolases to lysosomes, ultimately promoting viral egress.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, uses the host endolysosomal system for entry, replication, and egress. Previous studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virulence factor ORF3a interacts with the lysosomal tethering factor HOPS complex and blocks HOPS-mediated late endosome and autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to hyperactivation of the late endosomal and lysosomal small GTP-binding protein Rab7, which is dependent on ORF3a expression. We also observed Rab7 hyperactivation in naturally occurring ORF3a variants encoded by distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. We found that ORF3a, in complex with Vps39, sequesters the Rab7 GAP TBC1D5 and displaces Rab7 from this complex. Thus, ORF3a disrupts the GTP hydrolysis cycle of Rab7, which is beneficial for viral production, whereas the Rab7 GDP-locked mutant strongly reduces viral replication. Hyperactivation of Rab7 in ORF3a-expressing cells impaired CI-M6PR retrieval from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, disrupting the biosynthetic transport of newly synthesized hydrolases to lysosomes. Furthermore, the tethering of the Rab7- and Arl8b-positive compartments was strikingly reduced upon ORF3a expression. As SARS-CoV-2 egress requires Arl8b, these findings suggest that ORF3a-mediated hyperactivation of Rab7 serves a multitude of functions, including blocking endolysosome formation, interrupting the transport of lysosomal hydrolases, and promoting viral egress.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>The research suggests that more frequent COVID-19 booster vaccinations, especially for older age groups and immunocompromised individuals, can effectively reduce severe COVID-19 cases, while younger populations may only benefit moderately; however, those with prior infection had lower benefits from frequent boosters.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>There is a public health need to understand how different frequencies of COVID-19 booster vaccines may mitigate the risk of severe COVID-19, while accounting for waning of protection and differential risk by age and immune status. By analyzing United States COVID-19 surveillance and seroprevalence data in a microsimulation model, here we show that more frequent COVID-19 booster vaccination (every 6‚Äì12 months) in older age groups and the immunocompromised population would effectively reduce the burden of severe COVID-19, while frequent boosters in the younger population may only provide modest benefit against severe disease. In persons 75+ years, the model estimated that annual boosters would reduce absolute annual risk of severe COVID-19 by 199 (uncertainty interval: 183‚Äì232) cases per 100,000 persons, compared to a one-time booster vaccination. In contrast, for persons 18‚Äì49 years, the model estimated that annual boosters would reduce this risk by 14 (10‚Äì19) cases per 100,000 persons. Those with prior infection had lower benefit of more frequent boosting, and immunocompromised persons had larger benefit. Scenarios with emerging variants with immune evasion increased the benefit of more frequent variant-targeted boosters. This study underscores the benefit of considering key risk factors to inform frequency of COVID-19 booster vaccines in public health guidance and ensuring at least annual boosters in high-risk populations.</p>

            <p>The study found that airborne transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible, with 61% of participants emitting culture-positive aerosols smaller than 10 micrometers in size for up to nine days after symptoms began; a nasopharyngeal Ct value below 17 suggests a high likelihood of infectious aerosol generation and a specific blood biosignature is highly predictive.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol remains contentious. Importantly, whether cough or breath-generated bioaerosols can harbor viable and replicating virus remains largely unclarified. We performed size-fractionated aerosol sampling (Andersen cascade impactor) and evaluated viral culturability in human cell lines (infectiousness), viral genetics, and host immunity in ambulatory participants with COVID-19. Sixty-one percent (27/44) and 50% (22/44) of participants emitted variant-specific culture-positive aerosols <10Œºm and <5Œºm, respectively, for up to 9 days after symptom onset. Aerosol culturability is significantly associated with lower neutralizing antibody titers, and suppression of transcriptomic pathways related to innate immunity and the humoral response. A nasopharyngeal Ct <17 rules-in ~40% of aerosol culture-positives and identifies those who are probably highly infectious. A parsimonious three transcript blood-based biosignature is highly predictive of infectious aerosol generation (PPV‚Äâ>‚Äâ95%). There is considerable heterogeneity in potential infectiousness i.e., only 29% of participants were probably highly infectious (produced culture-positive aerosols <5Œºm at ~6 days after symptom onset). These data, which comprehensively confirm variant-specific culturable SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol, inform the targeting of transmission-related interventions and public health containment strategies emphasizing improved ventilation.</p>

            <p>This research study found that primary healthcare workers in metropolitan France had a similar rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population, with risk factors being living in certain regions and having unprotected contact with a COVID-19 case within the household, rather than occupational factors.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Data on the SARS-CoV-2 infection among primary health care workers (PHCWs) are scarce but essential to reflect on policy regarding prevention and control measures. We assessed the prevalence of PHCWs who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with modeling from the general population in metropolitan France, and associated factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among general practitioners (GPs), pediatricians, dental and pharmacy workers in primary care between May and August 2021. Participants volunteered to provide a dried-blood spot for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assessment and completed a questionnaire. The primary outcome was defined as the detection of infection-induced antibodies (anti-nucleocapsid IgG, and for non-vaccinees: anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies) or previous self-reported infection (positive RT-qPCR or antigenic test, or positive ELISA test before vaccination). Estimates were adjusted using weights for representativeness and compared with prediction from the general population. Poisson regressions were used to quantify associated factors. The analysis included 1612 PHCWs. Weighted prevalences were: 31.7% (95% CI 27.5‚Äì36.0) for GPs, 28.7% (95% CI 24.4‚Äì33.0) for pediatricians, 25.2% (95% CI 20.6‚Äì31.0) for dentists, and 25.5% (95% CI 18.2‚Äì34.0) for pharmacists. Estimates were compatible with model predictions for the general population. PHCWs more likely to be infected were: GPs compared to pharmacist assistants (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.26; CI 95% 1.01‚Äì5.07), those living in √éle-de-France (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.53; CI 95% 1.14‚Äì2.05), South-East (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.57; CI 95% 1.19‚Äì2.08), North-East (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.81; CI 95% 1.38‚Äì2.37), and those having an unprotected contact with a COVID-19 case within the household (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.48; CI 95% 1.22‚Äì1.80). Occupational factors were not associated with infection. In conclusion, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for PHCWs was more likely to have occurred in the community rather than at their workplace.</p>

            <p>This study found that four Omicron lineages circulated among children between December 2021 and November 2022, with most infections occurring in those under one year old; additionally, the presence of certain genetic variations was associated with moderate/severe COVID-19 cases.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron clade has shown a marked degree of variability and different clinical presentation compared with previous clades. Here we demonstrate that at least four Omicron lineages circulated in children since December 2021, and studied until November 2022: BA.1 (33.6%), BA.2 (40.6%), BA.5 (23.7%) and BQ.1 (2.1%). At least 70% of infections concerned children under 1¬†year, most of them being infected with BA.2 lineages (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ201, 75.6%). Looking at SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability, 69 SNPs were found to be significantly associated in pairs, (phi‚Äâ<‚Äâ‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ0.3 or‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.3 and p-value‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). 16 SNPs were involved in 4 distinct clusters (bootstrap‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.75). One of these clusters (A23040G, A27259C, T23617G, T23620G) was also positively associated with moderate/severe COVID-19 presentation (AOR [95% CI] 2.49 [1.26‚Äì4.89] p-value: 0.008) together with comorbidities (AOR [95% CI] 2.67 [1.36‚Äì5.24] p-value: 0.004). Overall, these results highlight the extensive SARS-CoV-2 Omicron circulation in children, mostly aged‚Äâ<‚Äâ1¬†year, and provide insights on viral diversification even considering low-abundant SNPs, finally suggesting the potential contribution of viral diversification in affecting disease severity.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 into a seasonal pathogen along with the emergence of new variants, underscores the need for dynamic and adaptable responses, emphasizing the importance of sustained vaccination strategies. This observer-blind, double-dummy, randomized immunobridging phase 2 study (NCT05175742) aimed to compare the immunogenicity induced by two doses of 40¬†Œºg PTX-COVID19-B vaccine candidate administered 28¬†days apart, with the response induced by two doses of 30¬†¬µg Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2), administered 21¬†days apart, in Nucleocapsid-protein seronegative adults 18‚Äì64¬†years of age. Both vaccines were administrated via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. Two weeks after the second dose, the neutralizing antibody (NAb) geometric mean titer ratio and seroconversion rate met the non-inferiority criteria, successfully achieving the primary immunogenicity endpoints of the study. PTX-COVID19-B demonstrated similar safety and tolerability profile to BNT162b2 vaccine. The lowest NAb response was observed in subjects with low-to-undetectable NAb at baseline or no reported breakthrough infection. Conversely, participants who experienced breakthrough infections during the study exhibited higher NAb titers. This study also shows induction of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses by PTX-COVID19-B. In conclusion, the vaccine candidate PTX-COVID19-B demonstrated favourable safety profile along with immunogenicity similar to the active comparator BNT162b2 vaccine.</p>

            <p>This study found that individuals who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines had higher risks of temporary side effects such as physical exhaustion, fever, and muscle/joint pain compared to unvaccinated individuals, but no concerning signs of long-term self-reported physical, cognitive, or fatigue symptoms were observed.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Many individuals who refuse COVID-19 vaccination have concerns about long-term side effects. Here, we report findings on self-reported symptoms from a Danish survey- and register study. The study included 34,868 vaccinated primary course recipients, 95.8% of whom received mRNA vaccines, and 1,568 unvaccinated individuals. Participants had no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using g-computation on logistic regression, risk differences (RDs) for symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons were estimated with adjustments for possible confounders. Within six weeks after vaccination, higher risks were observed for physical exhaustion (RD 4.9%, 95% CI 1.1% to 8.4%), fever or chills (RD 4.4%, 95% CI 2.1% to 6.7%), and muscle/joint pain (RD 7.0%, 95% CI 3.1% to 10.7%), compared to unvaccinated individuals. Beyond twenty-six weeks, risks were higher among the vaccinated for sleeping problems (RD 3.0, 95% 0.2 to 5.8), fever or chills (RD 2.0, 95% CI 0.4 to 3.6), reduced/altered taste (RD 1.2, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.3) and shortness of breath (RD 2.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 4.0). However, when examining pre-omicron responses only, the difference for reduced/altered taste was significant. As expected, the risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, fever or chills, and muscle/joint pain was higher among persons who responded within six weeks of completing the primary course. No significant differences were observed for the 7-25-week period after vaccination. Associations for the period beyond 26 weeks must be interpreted with caution and in the context of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection, wide confidence intervals, and multiple testing. Overall, we observe no concerning signs of long-term self-reported physical, cognitive, or fatigue symptoms after vaccination.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emphasized the need to explore how variations in the immune system relate to the severity of the disease. This study aimed to explore inter-individual variation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing T cell, B cell, and innate cell immune subsets among primary infected children and adults (i.e., those who had never experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection nor received vaccination previously), with varying disease severity after infection. We also examined immune subset kinetics in convalescent individuals compared to those with persistent infection to identify possible markers of immune dysfunction. Distinct immune subset differences were observed between infected adults and children, as well as among adult cases with mild, moderate, and severe disease. IgM memory B cells were absent in moderate and severe cases whereas frequencies of B cells with a lack of surface immunoglobulin expression were significantly higher in severe cases. Interestingly, these immune subsets remained stable during recovery implying that these subsets could be associated with underlying baseline immune variation. Our results offer insights into the potential immune markers associated with severe COVID-19 and provide a foundation for future research in this area.</p>

            <p>This study found that defects in iron homeostasis, dysregulated erythropoiesis, and immune dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection might contribute to persistent symptoms, or PASC, and could potentially be targeted for treatment.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection are increasingly reported, although the drivers of post-acute sequelae (PASC) of COVID-19 are unclear. Here we assessed 214 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, with varying disease severity, for one year from COVID-19 symptom onset to determine the early correlates of PASC. A multivariate signature detected beyond two weeks of disease, encompassing unresolving inflammation, anemia, low serum iron, altered iron-homeostasis gene expression and emerging stress erythropoiesis; differentiated those who reported PASC months later, irrespective of COVID-19 severity. A whole-blood heme-metabolism signature, enriched in hospitalized patients at month 1‚Äì3 post onset, coincided with pronounced iron-deficient reticulocytosis. Lymphopenia and low numbers of dendritic cells persisted in those with PASC, and single-cell analysis reported iron maldistribution, suggesting monocyte iron loading and increased iron demand in proliferating lymphocytes. Thus, defects in iron homeostasis, dysregulated erythropoiesis and immune dysfunction due to COVID-19 possibly contribute to inefficient oxygen transport, inflammatory disequilibrium and persisting symptomatology, and may be therapeutically tractable.</p>

            <p>This research study found that post-COVID-19 syndrome can cause significant alterations in the functional connectome of the brain, which may be responsible for the lingering fatigue, cognitive issues, affective symptoms, and sleep disturbances experienced by some patients even seven months after infection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a serious complication following SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized primarily by fatigue and cognitive complaints. Although first metabolic and structural imaging alterations in Post-COVID-19 syndrome have been identified, their functional consequences remain unknown. Thus, we explored the impact of Post-COVID-19 syndrome on the functional connectome of the brain providing a deeper understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. In a cross-sectional observational study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 66 patients with Post-COVID-19 syndrome after mild infection (mean age 42.3 years, 57 female) and 57 healthy controls (mean age 42.1 years, 38 female) with a mean time of seven months after acute COVID-19 were analysed using a graph theoretical approach. Network features were quantified using measures including mean distance, nodal degree, betweenness and Katz centrality, and compared between both groups. Graph measures were correlated with clinical measures quantifying fatigue, cognitive function, affective symptoms and sleep disturbances. Alterations were mainly found in the brainstem, olfactory cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus and cerebellum on average seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, strong correlations between fatigue severity, cognitive functioning and daytime sleepiness from clinical scales and graph measures were observed. Our study confirms functional relevance of brain imaging changes in Post-COVID-19 syndrome as mediating factors for persistent symptoms and improves our pathophysiological understanding.</p>

            <p>This study shows that recovered COVID-19 patients may develop long-term symptoms due to lower PD-1 in CD8+T cells, caused by increased IFN-Œ≥ which regulates the AKT/GSK3Œ≤ signaling pathway.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Post-COVID-19 syndrome may be associated with the abnormal immune status. Compared with the unexposed age-matched elder group, PD-1 in the CD8+T cells from recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly lower. IFN-Œ≥ in the plasma of COVID-19 convalescent patients was increased, which inhibited PD-1 expression in CD8+T cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients. scRNA-seq bioinformatics analysis revealed that AKT/GSK3Œ≤ may regulate the INF-Œ≥/PD-1 axis in CD8+T cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients. In parallel, an IFN-Œ≥ neutralizing antibody reduced AKT and increased GSK3Œ≤ in PBMCs. An AKT agonist (SC79) significantly decreased p-GSK3Œ≤. Moreover, AKT decreased PD-1 on CD8+T cells, and GSK3Œ≤ increased PD-1 on CD8+T cells according to flow cytometry analysis. Collectively, we demonstrated that recovered COVID-19 patients may develop long COVID. Increased IFN-Œ≥ in the plasma of recovered Wuhan COVID-19 patients contributed to PD-1 downregulation on CD8+T cells by regulating the AKT/GSK3Œ≤ signaling pathway.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The XBB.1.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly achieved global dominance and exhibits a high growth advantage over previous variants. Preliminary reports suggest that the success of XBB.1.5 stems from mutations within its spike glycoprotein, causing immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding. We present receptor binding studies that demonstrate retention of binding contacts with the human ACE2 receptor and a striking decrease in binding to mouse ACE2 due to the revertant R493Q mutation. Despite extensive evasion of antibody binding, we highlight a region on the XBB.1.5 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) that is recognized by serum antibodies from a donor with hybrid immunity, collected prior to the emergence of the XBB.1.5 variant. T cell assays reveal high frequencies of XBB.1.5 spike-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells amongst donors with hybrid immunity, with the CD4+T cells skewed towards a Th1 cell phenotype and having attenuated effector cytokine secretion as compared to ancestral spike protein-specific cells. Thus, while the XBB.1.5 variant has retained efficient human receptor binding and gained antigenic alterations, it remains susceptible to recognition by T cells induced via vaccination and previous infection.</p>

            <p>This study found that after 6 months, around 36% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia still had lung damage and nearly 15% had fibrotic changes; factors like age, invasive ventilation, and smoking increased the likelihood of these outcomes.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>This study aimed to assess pulmonary changes at 6-month follow-up CT and predictors of pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes in COVID-19 pneumonia patients in China following relaxation of COVID restrictions in 2022. A total of 271 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between November 29, 2022 and February 10, 2023 were prospectively evaluated at 6¬†months. CT characteristics and Chest CT scores of pulmonary abnormalities were compared between the initial and the 6-month CT. The association of demographic and clinical factors with CT residual abnormalities or fibrotic-like changes were assessed using logistic regression. Follow-up CT scans were obtained at a median of 177¬†days (IQR, 170‚Äì185¬†days) after hospital admission. Pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes were found in 98 (36.2%) and 39 (14.4%) participants. In multivariable analysis of pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes, the top three predictive factors were invasive ventilation (OR 13.6; 95% CI 1.9, 45; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ.001), age‚Äâ>‚Äâ60¬†years (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3, 39; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01), paxlovid (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.04, 0.48; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01) and invasive ventilation (OR 10.3; 95% CI 2.9, 33; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.002), paxlovid (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.03, 0.48; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01), smoker (OR 9.9; 95% CI 2.4, 31; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01), respectively.  The 6-month follow-up CT of recent COVID-19 pneumonia cases in China showed a considerable proportion of the patients with pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes. Antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 like paxlovid may be beneficial for long-term regression of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regions were an important epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Through the COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Regional Network (COVIGEN), LAC countries produced an important number of genomic sequencing data that made possible an enhanced SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance capacity in the Americas, paving the way for characterization of emerging variants and helping to guide the public health response. In this study we analyzed approximately 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated between February 2020 and March 2022 by multiple genomic surveillance efforts in LAC and reconstructed the diffusion patterns of the main variants of concern (VOCs) and of interest (VOIs) possibly originated in the Region. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the spread of variants Gamma, Lambda and Mu reflects human mobility patterns due to variations of international air passenger transportation and gradual lifting of social distance measures previously implemented in countries. Our results highlight the potential of genetic data to reconstruct viral spread and unveil preferential routes of viral migrations that are shaped by human mobility patterns.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>We conduct a large (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ6567) online experiment to measure the features of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that citizens of six European countries perceive to lower the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2 the most. We collected data in Bulgaria (n=‚Äâ1069), France (n=‚Äâ1108), Poland (n=‚Äâ1104), Italy (n=‚Äâ1087), Spain (n=‚Äâ1102) and Sweden (n=‚Äâ1097). Based on the features of the most widely adopted public health guidelines to reduce SARS-Cov-2 transmission (mask wearing vs not, outdoor vs indoor contact, short vs 90¬†min meetings, few vs many people present, and physical distancing of 1 or 2 m), we conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to estimate the public‚Äôs perceived risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in scenarios that presented mutually exclusive constellations of these features. Our findings indicate that participants‚Äô perception of transmission risk was most influenced by the NPI attributes of mask-wearing and outdoor meetings and the least by NPI attributes that focus on physical distancing, meeting duration, and meeting size. Differentiating by country, gender, age, cognitive style (reflective or intuitive), and perceived freight of COVID-19 moreover allowed us to identify important differences between subgroups. Our findings highlight the importance of improving health policy communication and citizens‚Äô health literacy about the design of NPIs and the transmission risk of SARS-Cov-2 and potentially future viruses.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a major challenge worldwide for the past years with high morbidity and mortality rates. While vaccination was the cornerstone to control the pandemic and disease spread, concerns regarding safety and adverse events (AEs) have been raised lately. A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1st and January 22nd, 2022, in six Arabic countries namely Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Algeria. We utilized a self-administered questionnaire validated in Arabic which encompassed two main parts. The first was regarding sociodemographic data while the second was about COVID-19 vaccination history, types, doses, and experienced AEs. A multistage sampling was employed in each country, involving the random selection of three governorates from each country, followed by the selection of one urban area and one rural area from each governorate. We included the responses of 1564 participants. The most common AEs after the first and second doses were local AEs (67.9% and 46.6%, respectively) followed by bone pain and myalgia (37.6% and 31.8%, respectively). After the third dose, the most common AEs were local AEs (45.7%) and fever (32.4%). Johnson and Johnson, Sputnik Light, and Moderna vaccines showed the highest frequency of AEs. Factors associated with AEs after the first dose included an increase in age (aOR of 61‚Äì75 years compared to the 12‚Äì18 years group: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.59‚Äì4.25, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001) and male gender (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63‚Äì0.82, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The cumulative post-vaccination COVID-19 disease was reported with Sinovac (16.1%), Sinopharm (15.8%), and Johnson and Johnson (14.9) vaccines. History of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increases the risk of post-vaccination COVID-19 after the first, second, and booster doses (OR: 3.09, CI: 1.9‚Äì5.07, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001; OR: 2.56, CI: 1.89‚Äì3.47, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001; and OR: 2.94, CI: 1.6‚Äì5.39, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0005 respectively). In conclusion, AEs were common among our participants, especially local AEs. Further extensive studies are needed to generate more generalizable data regarding the safety of different vaccines.</p>

            <p>This study found that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a stabilized Spike glycoprotein (S-29) provided partial protection against weight loss, but reduced efficacy was observed in geriatric animals, emphasizing the need for testing vaccine effectiveness in older animals during preclinical evaluation.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Age is associated with reduced efficacy of vaccines and linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Here we determined the impact of ageing on the efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a stabilised Spike glycoprotein (S-29) that had previously shown high efficacy in young animals. Thirteen to 18-month-old golden Syrian hamsters (GSH) and 22‚Äì23-month-old K18-hCAE2 mice were immunised twice with S-29 protein in AddaVaxTMadjuvant. GSH were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 either two weeks or four months after the booster dose, while all K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally inoculated two weeks after the second immunisation. Body weight and clinical signs were recorded daily post-inoculation. Lesions and viral load were investigated in different target tissues. Immunisation induced seroconversion and production of neutralising antibodies; however, animals were only partially protected from weight loss. We observed a significant reduction in the amount of viral RNA and a faster viral protein clearance in the tissues of immunized animals. Infectious particles showed a faster decay in vaccinated animals while tissue lesion development was not altered. In GSH, the shortest interval between immunisation and inoculation reduced RNA levels in the lungs, while the longest interval was equally effective in reducing RNA in nasal turbinates; viral nucleoprotein amount decreased in both tissues. In mice, immunisation was able to improve the survival of infected animals. Despite the high protection shown in young animals, S-29 efficacy was reduced in the geriatric population. Our research highlights the importance of testing vaccine efficacy in older animals as part of preclinical vaccine evaluation.</p>

            <p>This study found that liver transplant recipients are less responsive to mRNA vaccines due to immunosuppression, but a third vaccine dose can improve both humoral responses and spike-specific CD4+T-cell responses in these patients. However, it does not provide a booster effect for spike-specific memory CD8+T-cell responses.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Liver transplant recipients (LTRs) are at a high risk of severe COVID-19 owing to immunosuppression and comorbidities. LTRs are less responsive to mRNA vaccines than healthy donors (HDs) or other immunosuppressed patients. However, the disruption mechanism in humoral and cellular immune memory responses is unclear. We longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma samples from HDs (n=‚Äâ44) and LTRs (n=‚Äâ54) who received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. We measured the levels of anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies and spike-specific CD4+and CD8+T-cell responses. Here, we show that the induction of anti-RBD IgG was weaker in LTRs than in HDs. The use of multiple immunosuppressive drugs is associated with lower antibody titers than only calcineurin inhibitor, and limits the induction of CD4+T-cell responses. However, spike-specific CD4+T-cell and antibody responses improved with a third vaccination. Furthermore, mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific CD8+T¬†cells are quantitatively, but not qualitatively, limited to LTRs. Both CD4+and CD8+T¬†cells react to omicron sublineages, regardless of the presence in HDs or LTRs. However, there is no boosting effect of spike-specific memory CD8+T-cell responses after a third vaccination in HDs or LTRs. The third mRNA vaccination improves both humoral responses and spike-specific CD4+T-cell responses in LTRs but provides no booster effect for spike-specific memory CD8+T-cell responses. A third mRNA vaccination could be helpful in LTRs to prevent severe COVID-19, although further investigation is required to elicit CD8+T-cell responses in LTRs and HDs.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The persisting risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the protection against such risk conferred by COVID-19 vaccination remains unclear. Here we conducted a retrospective territory-wide cohort study on 1,175,277 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by their vaccination status and non-infected controls to evaluate the risk of clinical sequelae, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using a territory-wide public healthcare database with population-based vaccination records in Hong Kong. A progressive reduction in risk of all-cause mortality was observed over one year between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and controls. Patients with complete vaccination or have received booster dose incurred a lower risk of health consequences including major cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality than unvaccinated or patients with incomplete vaccination 30-90 days after infection. Completely vaccinated and patients with booster dose of vaccines did not incur significant higher risk of health consequences from 271 and 91 days of infection onwards, respectively, whilst un-vaccinated and incompletely vaccinated patients continued to incur a greater risk of clinical sequelae for up to a year following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provided real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its persistence following infection.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a public health crisis.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Panbio and STANDARD Q COVID-19 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) against the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at one of the largest hospitals in southern Ethiopia. Nasopharyngeal samples, which were collected during the pandemic from individuals suspected of COVID-19 and stored at ‚àí¬†70¬†¬∞C, were analyzed in June and July 2022. The performance of the Panbio COVID-19 antigen tests was evaluated in 200 randomly selected nasopharyngeal samples (100 positives and 100 negatives for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 by¬†RT-PCR). The STANDARD Q test was evaluated using 100 positive and 50 negative samples. The respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 88%, 99%, 98.9% and 89.2% for the Panbio test and 91%, 98%, 98.9% and 84.5%, for the STANDARD Q test. The kappa values were 0.87 for the Panbio and 0.86 for the STANDARD Q test. Based on the findings presented here, the RDTs could be utilized as an alternative to conventional RT-PCR when it is challenging to diagnose COVID-19 owing to a lack of time, skilled lab personnel, or¬†suitable equipment or electricity.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Vaccinations against the SARS-CoV-2 are still crucial in combating the ongoing pandemic that has caused more than 700 million infections and claimed almost 7 million lives in the past four years. Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants have incurred mutations that challenge the protection against infection and severe disease by the current vaccines, potentially compromising vaccination efforts. We analyzed serum samples taken up to 9 months post third dose from 432 healthcare workers. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and microneutralization tests (MNT) were used to assess the prevalence of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants. In this serological analysis we show that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine combinations of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 mount SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies with similar kinetics, but with differing neutralization capabilities. The most recent Omicron variants, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, show a significant increase in the ability to escape vaccine and infection-induced antibody responses. Breakthrough infections in thrice vaccinated adults were seen in over 50% of the vaccinees, resulting in a stronger antibody response than without infection. Different three-dose vaccine combinations seem to induce considerable levels of neutralizing antibodies against most SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, the ability of the newer variants BQ1.1 and XBB 1.5 to escape vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses underlines the importance of updating vaccines as new variants emerge.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Viral clearance, antibody response and the mutagenic effect of molnupiravir has not been elucidated in at-risk populations. Non-hospitalised participants within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms randomised to receive molnupiravir (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ253) or Usual Care (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ324) were recruited to study viral and antibody dynamics and the effect of molnupiravir on viral whole genome sequence from 1437 viral genomes. Molnupiravir accelerates viral load decline, but virus is detectable by Day 5 in most cases. At Day 14 (9 days post-treatment), molnupiravir is associated with significantly higher viral persistence and significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titres compared to Usual Care. Serial sequencing reveals increased mutagenesis with molnupiravir treatment. Persistence of detectable viral RNA at Day 14 in the molnupiravir group is associated with higher transition mutations following treatment cessation. Viral viability at Day 14 is similar in both groups with post-molnupiravir treated samples cultured up to 9 days post cessation of treatment. The current 5-day molnupiravir course is too short. Longer courses should be tested to reduce the risk of potentially transmissible molnupiravir-mutated variants being generated. Trial registration: ISRCTN30448031</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The advent of SARS-CoV-2 variants with defined mutations that augment pathogenicity and/or increase immune evasiveness continues to stimulate global efforts to improve vaccine formulation and efficacy. The extraordinary advantages of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), including versatile design, scalability, and reproducibility, make them ideal candidates for developing next-generation mRNA vaccines against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we assess the efficacy of LNP-encapsulated mRNA booster vaccines encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for variants of concern (Delta, Omicron) and using a predecessor (YN2016C isolated from bats) strain spike protein to elicit durable cross-protective neutralizing antibody responses. The mRNA-LNP vaccines have desirable physicochemical characteristics, such as small size (~78‚Äânm), low polydispersity index (<0.13), and high encapsulation efficiency (>90%). We employ in vivo bioluminescence imaging to illustrate the capacity of our LNPs to induce robust mRNA expression in secondary lymphoid organs. In a BALB/c mouse model, a three-dose subcutaneous immunization of mRNA-LNPs vaccines achieved remarkably high levels of cross-neutralization against the Omicron B1.1.529 and BA.2 variants for extended periods of time (28 weeks) with good safety profiles for all constructs when used in a booster regime, including the YN2016C bat virus sequences. These findings have important implications for the design of mRNA-LNP vaccines that aim to trigger durable cross-protective immunity against the current and newly emerging variants.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections may act as viral reservoirs that could seed future outbreaks1,2,3,4,5, give rise to highly divergent lineages6,7,8and contribute to cases with post-acute COVID-19 sequelae (long COVID)9,10. However, the population prevalence of persistent infections, their viral load kinetics and evolutionary dynamics over the course of infections remain largely unknown. Here, using viral sequence data collected as part of a national infection survey, we identified 381 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNA at high titre persisting for at least 30 days, of which 54 had viral RNA persisting at least 60 days. We refer to these as ‚Äòpersistent infections‚Äô as available evidence suggests that they represent ongoing viral replication, although the persistence of non-replicating RNA cannot be ruled out in all. Individuals with persistent infection had more than 50% higher odds of self-reporting long COVID than individuals with non-persistent infection. We estimate that 0.1‚Äì0.5% of infections may become persistent with typically rebounding high viral loads and last for at least 60 days. In some individuals, we identified many viral amino acid substitutions, indicating periods of strong positive selection, whereas others had no consensus change in the sequences for prolonged periods, consistent with weak selection. Substitutions included mutations that are lineage defining for SARS-CoV-2 variants, at target sites for monoclonal antibodies and/or are commonly found in immunocompromised people11,12,13,14. This work has profound implications for understanding and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemiology and evolution.</p>

The interferon (IFN) response is critical for reducing replication and pathogenesis of many viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. Mounting evidence indicates that peroxisomes which are best known as metabolic organelles, function in the IFN response. Recently, we reported that the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling pathway strongly suppresses peroxisome biogenesis. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway would result in increased peroxisome formation and enhanced IFN production. Indeed, Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic RNA viruses in vitro and reduces viral load, inflammation and clinical symptoms in a mouse model of COVID-19. As such, targeting this cellular pathway may have prophylactic and/or therapeutic value in reducing the disease burden caused by emerging viral pathogens.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>A subunit vaccine called AKS-452, which targets the COVID-19 virus spike protein, was tested for safety and effectiveness in adults previously primed with other vaccines. The results show that the vaccine is safe and effective in increasing antibody levels, but these levels decreased over time. The vaccine also showed a good response against different variants of the virus, including Omicron, although at slightly lower levels compared to the original strain. Overall, this vaccine has promising safety and effectiveness profiles, and it can be easily manufactured and stored at room temperature, making it a potential option for global vaccination efforts without complex cold chain requirements.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>AKS-452, a subunit vaccine comprising an Fc fusion of the ancestral wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein receptor binding domain (SP/RBD), was evaluated without adjuvant in a single cohort, non-randomized, open-labelled phase II study (NCT05124483) at a single site in The Netherlands for safety and immunogenicity. A single 90‚Äâ¬µg subcutaneous booster dose of AKS-452 was administered to 71 adults previously primed with a registered mRNA- or adenovirus-based vaccine and evaluated for 273 days. All AEs were mild and no SAEs were attributable to AKS-452. While all subjects showed pre-existing SP/RBD binding and ACE2-inhibitory IgG titers, 60‚Äì68% responded to AKS-452 via ‚â•2-fold increase from days 28 to 90 and progressively decreased back to baseline by day 180 (days 28 and 90 mean fold-increases, 14.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ6.3 and 8.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.2). Similar response kinetics against RBD mutant proteins (including omicrons) were observed but with slightly reduced titers relative to WT. There was an expected strong inverse correlation between day-0 titers and the fold-increase in titers at day 28. AKS-452 enhanced neutralization potency against live virus, consistent with IgG titers. Nucleocapsid protein (Np) titers suggested infection occurred in 66% (46 of 70) of subjects, in which only 20 reported mild symptomatic COVID-19. These favorable safety and immunogenicity profiles support booster evaluation in a planned phase III universal booster study of this room-temperature stable vaccine that can be rapidly and inexpensively manufactured to serve vaccination at a global scale without the need of a complex distribution or cold chain.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) circulate worldwide yet remain understudied and unmitigated. The observation of elevated levels of HCoV reactive antibodies in COVID-19 patients highlights the urgent necessity of better understanding of HCoV specific immunity. Here, we characterized in-depth the de novo SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses and the boosting of HCoV-reactive antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection in individuals up to 98 years old. All the vaccinees were home-dwelling with no documented SARS-CoV-2 infection before receiving the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2). The first two vaccine doses elicited potent SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies in individuals up to 80 years. The third dose largely boosted the previously low S2 domain binding and neutralizing antibodies in elderly 80‚Äì90 years old, but less so in those above 90 years. The endemicbetacoronavirus(HKU1 and OC43) reactive antibodies were boosted in all vaccinees, although to a lesser extent in those above 80 years old. COVID-19 patients had potent elevation ofalpha-andbetacoronavirus(229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43) reactive antibodies. In both patients and vaccinees, S2 domain specific antibody increases correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and HCoV-reactive antibody responses in all ages, indicating S2 domain as a candidate for future universal coronavirus vaccine design.</p>

            <p>This research found that factors such as disease control status before infection, involvement of lung lesions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and recovery time from COVID-19 may increase the risk of RA flare after SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are widely prevalent worldwide. With frequent secondary and breakthrough infections, immune dysfunction in RA patients, and long-term use of immune preparations, SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a significant challenge to patients and rheumatologists. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection causes RA flares and what factors aggravate RA flares are poorly studied. A questionnaire survey was conducted on RA patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 after December 7, 2022, in China through a multicenter and inter-network platform regarding general personal condition, primary disease, comorbidity, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, viral infection, and impact on the primary disease. A total of 306 RA patients were included in this study, and the patient data were analyzed, in which the general condition of RA patients, medication use before SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-infection typing and manifestations, and medication adjustment did not affect the Flare of RA patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The control of disease before SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.10), RA involving pulmonary lesions (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.28), and the recovery time of COVID-19 (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.50) were risk factors for RA flare. RA involving pulmonary lesions, control status of disease before infection, and recovery time of COVID-19 disease are risk factors for RA flare after SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

            <p>This research aims to engineer a coronavirus vaccine with broader protection against current and future variants by stabilizing the S2 subunit of the spike protein, leading to immunization that neutralizes multiple sarbecoviruses and protects mice from lethal challenges in tests.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Ever-evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have diminished the effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines. Developing a coronavirus vaccine that offers a greater breadth of protection against current and future VOCs would eliminate the need to reformulate COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we rationally engineer the sequence-conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and characterize the resulting S2-only antigens. Structural studies demonstrate that the introduction of interprotomer disulfide bonds can lock S2 in prefusion trimers, although the apex samples a continuum of conformations between open and closed states. Immunization with prefusion-stabilized S2 constructs elicits broadly neutralizing responses against several sarbecoviruses and protects female BALB/c mice from mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 lethal challenge and partially protects female BALB/c mice from mouse-adapted SARS-CoV lethal challenge. These engineering and immunogenicity results should inform the development of next-generation pan-coronavirus therapeutics and vaccines.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Due to the synchronous circulation of seasonal influenza viruses and severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is need for routine vaccination for both COVID-19 and influenza to reduce disease severity. Here, we prepared individual WPVs composed of formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 WK 521 (Ancestral strain; Co WPV) or influenza virus [A/California/07/2009 (X-179A) (H1N1) pdm; Flu WPV] to produce a two-in-one Co/Flu WPV. Serum analysis from vaccinated mice revealed that a single dose of Co/Flu WPV induced antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies against both viruses, similar to those induced by either type of WPV alone. Following infection with either virus, mice vaccinated with Co/Flu WPV showed no weight loss, reduced pneumonia and viral titers in the lung, and lower gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, as observed with individual WPV-vaccinated. Furthermore, a pentavalent vaccine (Co/qFlu WPV) comprising of Co WPV and quadrivalent influenza vaccine (qFlu WPV) was immunogenic and protected animals from severe COVID-19. These results suggest that a single dose of the two-in-one WPV provides efficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections with no evidence of vaccine interference in mice. We propose that concomitant vaccination with the two-in-one WPV can be useful for controlling both diseases.</p>

            <p>This research study finds that older individuals, males, and those with specific health conditions had lower anti-S1 antibody levels after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting they may need more frequent re-vaccinations.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>This study investigates correlates of anti-S1 antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination in a U.S. population-based meta-cohort of adults participating in longstanding NIH-funded cohort studies. Anti-S1 antibodies were measured from dried blood spots collected between February 2021-August 2022 using Luminex-based microsphere immunoassays. Of 6245 participants, mean age was 73 years (range, 21-100), 58% were female, and 76% were non-Hispanic White. Nearly 52% of participants received the BNT162b2 vaccine and 48% received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Lower anti-S1 antibody levels are associated with age of 65 years or older, male sex, higher body mass index, smoking, diabetes, COPD and receipt of BNT16b2 vaccine (vs mRNA-1273). Participants with a prior infection, particularly those with a history of hospitalized illness, have higher anti-S1 antibody levels. These results suggest that adults with certain socio-demographic and clinical characteristics may have less robust antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination and could be prioritized for more frequent re-vaccination.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) had an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% (pre-vaccination), being 53% higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Among 9578 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the SCOURGE study, we found 133 cases (1.42%) with detectable clonal mosaicism for chromosome alterations (mCA) and 226 males (5.08%) with acquired loss of chromosome Y (LOY). Individuals with clonal mosaic events (mCA and/or LOY) showed a 54% increase in the risk of COVID-19 lethality. LOY is associated with transcriptomic biomarkers of immune dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and cardiovascular risk. Interferon-induced genes involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 are also down-regulated in LOY. Thus, mCA and LOY underlie at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential therapeutic and prognostic relevance, evaluation of clonal mosaicism should be implemented as biomarker of COVID-19 severity in elderly people.</p>

            <p>This study in Uganda investigated the immunopathology of COVID-19 across multiple phases of the pandemic, finding that severe cases were characterized by multifaceted host protein impairment and redox imbalance, with key roles for IL-7, IL-15, and lymphotoxin-Œ± in respiratory failure.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Little is known about the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in sub-Saharan Africa, where severe COVID-19 fatality rates are among the highest in the world and the immunological landscape is unique. In a prospective cohort study of 306 adults encompassing the entire clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda, we profile the peripheral blood proteome and transcriptome to characterize the immunopathology of COVID-19 across multiple phases of the pandemic. Beyond the prognostic importance of myeloid cell-driven immune activation and lymphopenia, we show that multifaceted impairment of host protein synthesis and redox imbalance define core biological signatures of severe COVID-19, with central roles for IL-7, IL-15, and lymphotoxin-Œ± in COVID-19 respiratory failure. While prognostic signatures are generally consistent in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-coinfection, type I interferon responses uniquely scale with COVID-19 severity in persons living with HIV. Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 severity peaked during phases dominated by A.23/A.23.1 and Delta B.1.617.2/AY variants. Independent of clinical severity, Delta phase COVID-19 is distinguished by exaggerated pro-inflammatory myeloid cell and inflammasome activation, NK and CD8+T cell depletion, and impaired host protein synthesis. Combining these analyses with a contemporary Ugandan cohort of adults hospitalized with influenza and other severe acute respiratory infections, we show that activation of epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor pathways are distinct features of COVID-19, deepening translational understanding of mechanisms potentially underlying SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our findings provide biological rationale for use of broad and targeted immunotherapies for severe COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa, illustrate the relevance of local viral and host factors to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology, and highlight underemphasized yet therapeutically exploitable immune pathways driving COVID-19 severity.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment and fatigue, can occur in both the acute infection phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and at later stages, yet the mechanisms that contribute to this remain unclear. Here we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes and proteomes of brainstem tissue from deceased individuals at various stages of COVID-19. We detected an inflammatory type I interferon response in acute COVID-19 cases, which resolves in the late disease phase. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we could localize two patterns of reaction to severe systemic inflammation, one neuronal with a direct focus on cranial nerve nuclei and a separate diffuse pattern affecting the whole brainstem. The latter reflects a bystander effect of the respiratory infection that spreads throughout the vascular unit and alters the transcriptional state of mainly oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes, while alterations of the brainstem nuclei could reflect the connection of the immune system and the central nervous system via, for example, the vagus nerve. Our results indicate that even without persistence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the central nervous system, local immune reactions are prevailing, potentially causing functional disturbances that contribute to neurological complications of COVID-19.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 despite the development of vaccines and a degree of herd immunity is partly due to viral evolution reducing vaccine and treatment efficacy. Serial infections of wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 in Balb/c mice yield mouse-adapted strains with greater infectivity and mortality. We investigate if passaging unmodified B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) 20‚Äâtimes in K18-ACE2 mice, expressing the human ACE2 receptor, in a BSL-3 laboratory without selective pressures, drives human health-relevant evolution and if evolution is lineage-dependent. Late-passage virus causes more severe disease, at organism and lung tissue scales, with late-passage Delta demonstrating antibody resistance and interferon suppression. This resistance co-occurs with a de novo spike S371F mutation, linked with both traits. S371F, an Omicron-characteristic mutation, is co-inherited at times with spike E1182G per Nanopore sequencing, existing in different within-sample viral variants at others. Both S371F and E1182G are linked to mammalian GOLGA7 and ZDHHC5 interactions, which mediate viral-cell entry and antiviral response. This study demonstrates SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs tendency to evolve with phenotypic consequences, its evolution varying by lineage, and suggests non-dominant quasi-species contribution.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a new entity that frequently causes pulmonary fibrosis and can become chronic. We performed a single-center parallel-group open-label pilot randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine A (CsA) in the development of ILD in the medium term among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive CsA plus standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary composite outcome was the percentage of patients without ILD 3¬†months after diagnosis of pneumonia and not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (response without requiring IMV). The key secondary composite outcomes were the percentage of patients who achieve a response requiring IMV or irrespective of the need for IMV, and adverse events. A total of 33 patients received at least one dose of CsA plus standard of care (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ17) or standard of care alone (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ16). No differences were found between the groups in the percentage of patients who achieved a response without requiring IMV or a response requiring IMV. A higher percentage of patients achieved a response irrespective of the need for IMV in the CsA plus standard of care group although the RR was almost significant 2.833 (95% CI, 0.908‚Äì8.840;p=‚Äâ0.057). No differences were found between the groups for adverse events. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, we were unable to demonstrate that CsA achieved a significant effect in preventing the development of ILD.

            <p>This study reveals that Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) might be an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2, allowing the virus to infect liver cells even when ACE2 is not expressed at significant levels, which could help explain liver damage in COVID-19 patients.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes multi-organ damage, which includes hepatic dysfunction, as observed in over 50% of COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, and studies have shown the presence of intracellular virus particles in human hepatocytes that express ACE2, but at extremely low levels. Consequently, we asked if hepatocytes might express receptors other than ACE2 capable of promoting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 activation library screening and found that Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) promoted SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of HeLa cells. In Huh-7 cells, simultaneous knockout ofACE2andASGR1prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. In the immortalized THLE-2 hepatocyte cell line and primary hepatic parenchymal cells, both of which barely expressed ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could successfully establish an infection. However, after treatment with ASGR1 antibody or siRNA targeting ASGR1, the infection rate significantly dropped, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infects hepatic parenchymal cells mainly through an ASGR1-dependent mechanism. We confirmed that ASGR1 could interact with Spike protein, which depends on receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). Finally, we also used Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to verify that SARS-CoV-2 could infect primary hepatic parenchymal cells. After inhibiting ASGR1 in primary hepatic parenchymal cells by siRNA, the infection efficiency of the live virus decreased significantly. Collectively, these findings indicate that ASGR1 is a candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that promotes infection of hepatic parenchymal cells.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Vaccines have proven effective in protecting populations against COVID-19, including the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells), the first approved recombinant protein vaccine in China. In this positive-controlled trial with 85 adult participants (Sf9 cells group:n=‚Äâ44; CoronaVac group:n=‚Äâ41), we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and protective effectiveness of a heterologous boost with the Sf9 cells vaccine in adults who had been vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine, and found a post-booster adverse events rate of 20.45% in the Sf9 cells group and 31.71% in the CoronaVac group (p=‚Äâ0.279), within 28 days after booster injection. Neither group reported any severe adverse events. Following the Sf9 cells vaccine booster, the geometric mean titer (GMT) of binding antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of prototype SARS-CoV-2 on day 28 post-booster was significantly higher than that induced by the CoronaVac vaccine booster (100,683.37 vs. 9,451.69,p<‚Äâ0.001). In the Sf9 cells group, GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against pseudo SARS-CoV-2 viruses (prototype and diverse variants of concern [VOCs]) increased by 22.23‚Äì75.93 folds from baseline to day 28 post-booster, while the CoronaVac group showed increases of only 3.29‚Äì10.70 folds. Similarly, neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 viruses (prototype and diverse VOCs) increased by 68.18‚Äì192.67 folds on day 14 post-booster compared with the baseline level, significantly greater than the CoronaVac group (19.67‚Äì37.67 folds). A more robust Th1 cellular response was observed with the Sf9 cells booster on day 14 post-booster (mean IFN-Œ≥+ spot-forming cells per 2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ105peripheral blood mononuclear cells: 26.66 vs. 13.59). Protective effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was approximately twice as high in the Sf9 cells group compared to the CoronaVac group (68.18% vs. 36.59%,p=‚Äâ0.004). Our study findings support the high protective effectiveness of heterologous boosting with the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (Sf9 cells) against symptomatic COVID-19 of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, while causing no apparent safety concerns.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Efficient pathogen enrichment and nucleic acid isolation are critical for accurate and sensitive diagnosis of infectious diseases, especially those with low pathogen levels. Our study introduces a biporous silica nanofilms-embedded sample preparation chip for pathogen and nucleic acid enrichment/isolation. This chip features unique biporous nanostructures comprising large and small pore layers. Computational simulations confirm that these nanostructures enhance the surface area and promote the formation of nanovortex, resulting in improved capture efficiency. Notably, the chip demonstrates a 100-fold lower limit of detection compared to conventional methods used for nucleic acid detection. Clinical validations using patient samples corroborate the superior sensitivity of the chip when combined with the luminescence resonance energy transfer assay. The enhanced sample preparation efficiency of the chip, along with the facile and straightforward synthesis of the biporous nanostructures, offers a promising solution for polymer chain reaction-free detection of nucleic acids.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Emerging and recurrent infectious diseases caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) continue to pose a significant threat to global public health security. In light of this ongoing threat, the development of a broad-spectrum drug to combat HCoVs is an urgently priority. Herein, we report a series of anti-pan-coronavirus ssDNA aptamers screened using Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). These aptamers have nanomolar affinity with the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and also show excellent binding efficiency to the N proteins of both SARS, MERS, HCoV-OC43 and -NL63 with affinity KDvalues of 1.31 to 135.36‚ÄânM. Such aptamer-based therapeutics exhibited potent antiviral activity against both the authentic SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and the Omicron variant (BA.5) with EC50values at 2.00‚ÄânM and 41.08‚ÄânM, respectively. The protein docking analysis also evidenced that these aptamers exhibit strong affinities for N proteins of pan-coronavirus and other HCoVs (‚àí229E and -HKU1). In conclusion, we have identified six aptamers with a high pan-coronavirus antiviral activity, which could potentially serve as an effective strategy for preventing infections by unknown coronaviruses and addressing the ongoing global health threat.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 due to compromised immune responses. Although vaccination is critical in preventing severe disease, KTRs have attenuated vaccination-induced immune responses due to underlying kidney disease and immunosuppressive therapies. In this study, the effect of different COVID-19 booster strategies on SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses was assessed in KTRs who showed a poor serological response after the first two mRNA-based primary vaccination doses. In these KTRs, a third vaccination dose led to an increase in antibody levels in the majority of patients. Production of IL-2 and IL-5 by SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells positively correlated with antibody levels, with stronger correlations compared to IFN-Œ≥ production, the ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô cytokine to measure T-cell responses. Our study underscores the significance a balanced T-cell cytokine response to achieve robust antibody responses in KTRs. Furthermore, we show that multiple cytokines to assess T-cell responses should be explored to identify individuals in need of tailored vaccination strategies.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The potential risks associated with organs from COVID-19-infected donors were unclear. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection status of corneas transplanted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the corneal preservation solution that was used for corneal transplantation. We also examined the postoperative health status of the recipients. This study included 144 transplants in 143 eyes. Ninety-nine eyes of imported corneas and 10 of the 14 corneas donated in the prefecture were PCR tested at our hospital, and all were SARS-CoV-2 negative. All corneal transplants were performed after confirming their SARS-CoV-2 negativity by a PCR using a corneal preservation solution at our hospital or a nasopharyngeal swab at a previous facility. Despite postoperative steroid administration, no patient developed COVID-19 infection until discharge. Hence, if the donor's nasopharyngeal swab test is SARS-CoV-2 negative, COVID-19 infection in the recipient due to corneal transplantation may be prevented. Since corneal transplant recipients are susceptible to infection due to prolonged steroid administration and are at high risk for severe diseases if infection occurs, SARS-CoV-2 detection testing using nasopharyngeal swabs in donors should be performed.</p>

            <p>This research suggests that the COVID-19 spike protein causes changes in lung cells leading to the accumulation of chondroitin sulfates, which are linked to fibrotic lung conditions and damage; inhibiting p38-MAPK may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 infections.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Immunostaining in lungs of patients who died with COVID-19 infection showed increased intensity and distribution of chondroitin sulfate and decline in N-acetylgalactostamine-4-sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B; ARSB). To explain these findings, human small airway epithelial cells were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (SPRBD) and transcriptional mechanisms were investigated. Phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-SMAD3 increased following exposure to the SPRBD, and their inhibition suppressed the promoter activation of the carbohydrate sulfotransferases CHST15 and CHST11, which contributed to chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. Decline in ARSB was mediated by phospho-38 MAPK-induced N-terminal Rb phosphorylation and an associated increase in Rb-E2F1 binding and decline in E2F1 binding to the ARSB promoter. The increases in chondroitin sulfotransferases were inhibited when treated with phospho-p38-MAPK inhibitors, SMAD3 (SIS3) inhibitors, as well as antihistamine desloratadine and antibiotic monensin. In the mouse model of carrageenan-induced systemic inflammation, increases in phospho-p38 MAPK and expression of CHST15 and CHST11 and declines in DNA-E2F binding and ARSB expression occurred in the lung, similar to the observed effects in this SPRBD model of COVID-19 infection. Since accumulation of chondroitin sulfates is associated with fibrotic lung conditions and diffuse alveolar damage, increased attention to p38-MAPK inhibition may be beneficial in ameliorating Covid-19 infections.</p>

            <p>This research investigates the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein's role in HEK293 cells, revealing its influence on apoptosis, interferon signaling, and cytokine production, potentially leading to targeted therapies for COVID-19.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The emergence of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has left an indelible mark on a global scale, causing countless infections and fatalities. This investigation delves into the role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein within the HEK293 cells, shedding light on its influence over apoptosis, interferon signaling, and cytokines production. The N gene was amplified, inserted into the pAdTrack-CMV vector, and then transfected to the HEK293 cells. Changes in the expression of IRF3, IRF7, IFN-Œ≤, BAK, BAX, and BCL-2 genes were evaluated. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines of IL-6, IL-12, IL-1Œ≤, and TNF-Œ± were also determined. The N protein exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect by modulating critical genes associated with apoptosis, including BAK, BAX, and BCL-2. This effect potentially prolonged the survival of infected cells. The N protein also played a role in immune evasion by suppressing the interferon pathway, evidenced by the downregulation of essential interferon regulatory factors of IRF3 and IRF7, and IFN-Œ≤ expression. The N protein expression led to a substantial increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines of IL-6, IL-12, IL-1Œ≤, and TNF-Œ±. The N protein emerged as a versatile factor and was exerted over apoptosis, interferon signaling, and cytokine production. These findings carry potential implications for the development of targeted therapies to combat COVID-19 and mitigate its global health impact.</p>

            <p>This study identified promising therapeutic candidates, such as acetyl 11-keto-boswellic acid (AKBA) and its derivatives, that target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus by using a structure-based virtual screening and biochemical assay, showing potential for treating COVID-19.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>COVID-19 appeared as a highly contagious disease after its outbreak in December 2019 by the virus, named SARS-CoV-2. The threat, which originated in Wuhan, China, swiftly became an international emergency. Among different genomic products, spike protein of virus plays a crucial role in the initiation of the infection by binding to the human lung cells, therefore, SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs spike protein is a promising therapeutic target. Using a combination of a structure-based virtual screening and biochemical assay, this study seeks possible therapeutic candidates that specifically target the viral spike protein. A database of‚Äâ~‚Äâ850 naturally derived compounds was screened against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to find natural inhibitors. Using virtual¬†screening and inhibitory experiments, we identifiedacetyl 11-keto-boswellic acid(AKBA) as a promising molecule for spike protein, which encouraged us to scan the rest of AKBA derivatives in our in-house database via 2D-similarity searching. Later 19 compounds with‚Äâ>‚Äâ85% similarity with AKBA were selected and docked with receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein. Those hits declared significant interactions at the RBD interface, best possess and excellent drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties with high gastrointestinal absorption (GIA) without toxicity and allergenicity. Ourin-silicoobservations were eventually validated by in vitro bioassay, interestingly, 10 compounds(A3, A4, C3, C6A, C6B, C6C, C6E, C6H, C6I,andC6J)displayed significant inhibitory ability with good percent inhibition (range:‚Äâ>‚Äâ72‚Äì90). The compoundsC3(90.00%),C6E(91.00%),C6C(87.20%), andC6D(86.23%) demonstrated excellent anti-SARS CoV-2 spike protein activities. The docking interaction of high percent inhibition of inhibitor compoundsC3andC6Ewas confirmed by MD Simulation. In the molecular dynamics simulation, we observed the stable dynamics of spike protein inhibitor complexes and the influence of inhibitor binding on the protein‚Äôs conformational arrangements. The binding free energy ŒîGTOTALofC3(‚àí38.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.08¬†kcal/mol) andC6E(‚àí41.98‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.08¬†kcal/mol) respectively indicate a strong binding affinity to Spike protein active pocket. These findings demonstrate that these molecules particularly inhibit the function of spike protein and, therefore have the potential to be evaluated as drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

            <p>This review examines the connection between COVID-19 and thyroid dysfunction, including long-term effects and interactions with vaccination, to provide updated information on this relationship for evidence-based practice recommendations.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 772 million people globally. While lung damage is the major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of this disease, the involvement of multiple organs, including the endocrine glands, has been reported. This Review aims to provide an updated summary of evidence regarding COVID-19 and thyroid dysfunction, incorporating highlights of recent advances in the field, particularly in relation to long COVID and COVID-19 vaccination. Since subacute thyroiditis following COVID-19 was first reported in May 2020, thyroid dysfunction associated with COVID-19 has been increasingly recognized, secondary to direct and indirect effects on the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìthyroid axis. Here, we summarize the epidemiological evidence, pattern and clinical course of thyroid dysfunction following COVID-19 and examine radiological, molecular and histological evidence of thyroid involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is also timely to examine the course and implication of thyroid dysfunction in the context of long COVID owing to the large population of survivors of COVID-19 worldwide. This Review also analyses the latest evidence on the relationship between the therapeutics and vaccination for COVID-19 and thyroid dysfunction. To conclude, evidence-based practice recommendations for thyroid function testing during and following COVID-19 and concerning COVID-19 vaccination are proposed.</p>

            <p>This research abstract highlights the importance of developing a broadly protective vaccine against ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses, including SARS-like viruses, as updated variant-matched formulations may not provide sufficient protection. The study introduces bivalent and trivalent vaccine formulations using a spike protein nanoparticle platform that has shown to protect hamsters against multiple virus challenges, including Omicron variants and bat sarbecoviruses. These results demonstrate the potential of their trivalent protein-nanoparticle cocktail in providing broad protection against SARS-CoV-2-like and SARS-CoV-1-like sarbecoviruses.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The 2002‚ÄâSARS outbreak, the 2019 emergence of COVID-19, and the continuing evolution of immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants together highlight the need for a broadly protective vaccine against ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses. While updated variant-matched formulations are a step in the right direction, protection needs to extend beyond SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to include SARS-like viruses. Here, we introduce bivalent and trivalent vaccine formulations using our spike protein nanoparticle platform that completely protect female hamsters against BA.5 and XBB.1 challenges with no detectable virus in the lungs. The trivalent cocktails elicit highly neutralizing responses against all tested Omicron variants and the bat sarbecoviruses SHC014 and WIV1. Finally, our 614D/SHC014/XBB trivalent spike formulation completely protects human ACE2-transgenic female hamsters against challenges with WIV1 and SHC014 with no detectable virus in the lungs. Collectively, these results illustrate that our trivalent protein-nanoparticle cocktail can provide broad protection against SARS-CoV-2-like and SARS-CoV-1-like sarbecoviruses.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This study found that pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a very low risk (less than 1%) of transmitting the virus to their newborns, and maternal antibody transfer to the fetus is more efficient when infection occurs during the first or second trimester.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>To quantify transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibody transfer in pregnant women and their newborns according to the gestational age at maternal infection. A prospective observational multicenter study including pregnant women with a positive RT-PCR or a positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 and compatible symptoms, from April to December 2020, in 11 French maternities. The study was designed to obtain a systematic collection of mother-infant dyad‚Äôs samples at birth. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by RT-PCR. IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed according to the gestational age at maternal infection. The primary outcome was the rate of SARS CoV-2 materno-fetal transmission at birth. The secondary outcome was the quantification of materno-fetal antibody transfer. Maternal and neonatal outcomes at birth were additionally assessed. Among 165 dyads enrolled, one congenital infection was confirmed {n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1 (0.63%) IC95%[0.02%; 3.48%]}. The average placental IgG antibody transfer ratio was 1.27 (IC 95% [0.69‚Äì2.89]). The transfer ratio increased with increasing time between the onset of maternal infection and delivery (PValue‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0001). Maternal and neonatal outcomes were reassuring. We confirmed the very low rate of SARS-CoV-2 transplacental transmission (<‚Äâ1%). Maternal antibody transfer to the fetus was more efficient when the infection occurred during the first and second trimester of pregnancy.</p>
