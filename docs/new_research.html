            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate a fractal-fractional-order mathematical model with the influence of hospitalized patients and the impact of vaccination with fractal-fractional operators. The respective derivatives are considered in the Caputo, Caputo Fabrizio, and Atangana‚ÄìBaleanu senses of fractional order\( \alpha \)and fractal dimension\( \tau \). For the proposed problem, some results regarding basic reproduction number and stability are given. Using the next-generation matrix approach, we have investigated the global and local stability of several types of equilibrium points. We provide a detailed analysis of the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Moreover, we fit the model with the real data of Pakistan from June 01, 2020, till March 24, 2021. Then, we use the fractal-fractional derivative to find a numerical solution for the model. MATLAB software is used for numerical illustration. Graphical presentations corresponding to different parameteric values are given as well.</p>

            <p>This research uses hierarchical clustering analysis to investigate SARS-CoV-2 strain relationships, finding that specific strains, like BF.28, BE.1.1.1, BA.5.3, and BA.5.6.4, may be the majority sources for future evolution, while others show increased immune evasion, transmissibility, and pathogenicity, highlighting the need to closely monitor these trends for public health and society.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>To explore the differences and relationships between the available SARS-CoV-2 strains and predict the potential evolutionary direction of these strains, we employ the hierarchical clustering analysis to investigate the evolutionary relationships between the SARS-CoV-2 strains utilizing the genomic sequences collected in China till January 7, 2023. We encode the sequences of the existing SARS-CoV-2 strains into numerical data throughk-mer algorithm, then propose four methods to select the representative sample from each type of strains to comprise the dataset for clustering analysis. Three hierarchical clustering algorithms named Ward-Euclidean, Ward-Jaccard, and Average-Euclidean are introduced through combing the Euclidean and Jaccard distance with the Ward and Average linkage clustering algorithms embedded in the OriginPro software. Experimental results reveal that BF.28, BE.1.1.1, BA.5.3, and BA.5.6.4 strains exhibit distinct characteristics which are not observed in other types of SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting their being the majority potential sources which the future SARS-CoV-2 strains‚Äô evolution from. Moreover, BA.2.75, CH.1.1, BA.2, BA.5.1.3, BF.7, and B.1.1.214 strains demonstrate enhanced abilities in terms of immune evasion, transmissibility, and pathogenicity. Hence, closely monitoring the evolutionary trends of these strains is crucial to mitigate their impact on public health and society as far as possible.</p>

            <p>This study found that adults who previously had COVID-19 had higher levels of sNfL and sGFAP biomarkers, associated with cognitive impairment, even 10 months after the infection; however, these levels decreased over time but remained elevated compared to healthy controls.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Given the huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears of paramount importance to assess the cognitive effects on the population returning to work after COVID-19 resolution. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) represent promising biomarkers of neuro-axonal damage and astrocytic activation. In this cohort study, we explored the association between sNfL and sGFAP concentrations and cognitive performance in a group of 147 adult workers with a previous asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19, one week and, in 49 of them, ten months after SARS-Cov2 negativization and compared them to a group of 82 age and BMI-matched healthy controls (HCs). sNfL and sGFAP concentrations were assessed using SimoaTM assay Neurology 2-Plex B Kit. COVID-19 patients were interviewed one-on-one by trained physicians and had to complete a list of questionnaires, including the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ). At the first assessment (T0), sNfL and sGFAP levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in HCs (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001 for both). The eleven COVID-19 patients with cognitive impairment had significantly higher levels of sNfL and sGFAP than the others (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005 for both). At the subsequent follow-up (T1), sNfL and sGFAP levels showed a significant decrease (median sNfL 18.3¬†pg/mL; median sGFAP 77.2¬†pg/mL), although they were still higher than HCs (median sNfL 7.2¬†pg/mL, median sGFAP 63.5¬†pg/mL). Our results suggest an ongoing damage involving neurons and astrocytes after SARS-Cov2 negativization, which reduce after ten months even if still evident compared to HCs.</p>

            <p>This study reveals that Œ≤-escin and Aesculus hippocastanum L. seed extract have broad-spectrum antiviral properties against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, making them potential treatments for respiratory infections and future pandemics.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Respiratory viruses can cause life-threatening illnesses. The focus of treatment is on supportive therapies and direct antivirals. However, antivirals may cause resistance by exerting selective pressure. Modulating the host response has emerged as a viable therapeutic approach for treating respiratory infections. Additionally, considering the probable future respiratory virus outbreaks emphasizes the need for broad-spectrum therapies to be prepared for the next pandemics. One of the principal bioactive constituents found in the seed extract ofAesculus hippocastanumL. (AH) is Œ≤-escin. The clinical therapeutic role of Œ≤-escin and AH has been associated with their anti-inflammatory effects. Regarding their mechanism of action, we and others have shown that Œ≤-escin and AH affect NF-Œ∫B signaling. Furthermore, we have reported the virucidal and broad-spectrum antiviral properties of Œ≤-escin and AH against enveloped viruses such as RSV, in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that Œ≤-escin and AH have antiviral and virucidal activities against SARS-CoV-2 and CCoV, revealing broad-spectrum antiviral activity against coronaviruses. Likewise, they exhibited NF-Œ∫B and cytokine modulating activities in epithelial and macrophage cell lines infected with coronaviruses in vitro. Hence, Œ≤-escin and AH are promising broad-spectrum antiviral, immunomodulatory, and virucidal drugs against coronaviruses and respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.</p>

            <p>This research found that neutralizing antibodies play a crucial role in clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in individuals with immunosuppression due to HIV, while suppressive antiretroviral therapy helps prevent the evolution of escape mutants.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 clearance requires adaptive immunity but the contribution of neutralizing antibodies and T cells in different immune states is unclear. Here we ask which adaptive immune responses associate with clearance of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection in HIV-mediated immunosuppression after suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. We assembled a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected people in South Africa (n=‚Äâ994) including participants with advanced HIV disease characterized by immunosuppression due to T cell depletion. Fifty-four percent of participants with advanced HIV disease had prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection (>1 month). In the five vaccinated participants with advanced HIV disease tested, SARS-CoV-2 clearance associates with emergence of neutralizing antibodies but not SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells, while CD4 T cell responses were not determined due to low cell numbers. Further, complete HIV suppression is not required for clearance, although it is necessary for an effective vaccine response. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection led to SARS-CoV-2 evolution, including virus with extensive neutralization escape in a Delta variant infected participant. The results provide evidence that neutralizing antibodies are required for SARS-CoV-2 clearance in HIV-mediated immunosuppression recovery, and that suppressive ART is necessary to curtail evolution of co-infecting pathogens to reduce individual health consequences as well as public health risk linked with generation of escape mutants.</p>

            <p>This study examined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in psoriasis patients and its effects on their condition, finding that 84.2% were infected and risk factors included demographics, occupation, protection against COVID-19, vaccination status, nail impairment, and psoriasis severity; among those infected, 5.8% required hospitalization and 23.6% experienced exacerbation of their psoriasis, while booster dose vaccinations reduced the likelihood of COVID-19 complications.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In this study we aimed to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in psoriasis patients, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated risk factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February 2023 to March 2023. Information was obtained with online questionnaire about psoriasis patients on demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, vaccination, and routine protection against COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore risk factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection and exacerbation of psoriasis. A total of 613 participants were recruited. 516 (84.2%) were infected, and associated factors were sex, working status, routine protection against COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccination, impaired nail, infection exacerbate psoriasis, and severity of psoriasis. Among the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 30 (5.8%) required hospitalization, 122 (23.6%) had psoriasis exacerbation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associated factors were subtype of psoriasis, discontinuation of psoriasis treatment during SARS-CoV-2 infection, response following COVID-19 vaccination, and severity of psoriasis. Booster dose vaccination contributed a low probability of COVID-19 sequelae. COVID-19 vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness was unsatisfactory, while booster dose vaccination reduced the occurrence of COVID-19 sequelae in psoriasis patients of Southwest China. Patients treated with psoriasis shown to be safe, without a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19hospitalization compared to untreated patients. Stopping treatment during SARS-CoV-2 infection led to psoriasis exacerbation, so psoriasis treatment could be continued except severe adverse reaction.</p>

            <p>This study found that dietary supplementation with the prebiotic inulin improved survival rates and reduced weight loss in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting potential benefits for COVID-19 prevention through modifying gut microbiome and increasing beneficial short-chain fatty acids.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Current treatment options for COVID-19 are limited, with many antivirals and immunomodulators restricted to the most severe cases and preventative care limited to vaccination. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its increasing variants threaten to become a permanent fixture of our lives, this new reality necessitates the development of cost-effective and accessible treatment options for COVID-19. Studies have shown that there are correlations between the gut microbiome and severity of COVID-19, especially with regards to production of physiologically beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbes. In this study, we used a Syrian hamster model to study how dietary consumption of the prebiotic inulin affected morbidity and mortality resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. After two weeks of observation, we discovered that inulin supplementation attenuated morbid weight loss and increased survival rate in hamster subjects. An analysis of microbiome community structure showed significant alterations in 15 genera. Notably, there were also small increases in fecal DCA and a significant increase in serum DCA, perhaps highlighting a role for this secondary bile acid in conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2. In light of these results, inulin and other prebiotics are promising targets for future investigation as preventative treatment options for COVID-19.</p>

            <p>This study shows that immunity against SARS-CoV-2 can protect against virus challenge even without antibodies, emphasizing the importance of T cells and interferon-Œ≥ in combating severe infections and managing milder cases, which should be considered in vaccine development.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Vaccines have reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) morbidity and mortality, yet emerging variants challenge their effectiveness. The prevailing approach to updating vaccines targets the antibody response, operating under the presumption that it is the primary defense mechanism following vaccination or infection. This perspective, however, can overlook the role of T cells, particularly when antibody levels are low or absent. Here we show, through studies in mouse models lacking antibodies but maintaining functional B cells and lymphoid organs, that immunity conferred by prior infection or mRNA vaccination can protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge independently of antibodies. Our findings, using three distinct models inclusive of a novel human/mouse ACE2 hybrid, highlight that CD8+T cells are essential for combating severe infections, whereas CD4+T cells contribute to managing milder cases, with interferon-Œ≥ having an important function in this antibody-independent defense. These findings highlight the importance of T cell responses in vaccine development, urging a broader perspective on protective immunity beyond just antibodies.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has provided valuable lessons that deserve deep thought to prepare for the future. The decay pattern of surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the residences of COVID-19 patients is important but still unknown. We collected 2,233 surface samples from 21 categories of objects in 141 residences of COVID-19 patients in Shanghai when attacked by the omicron variant in spring 2022. Several characteristics of the patients and their residences were investigated to identify relevant associations. The decay of contamination was explored to determine the persistence. Approximately 8.7% of the surface samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The basin, water tap, and sewer inlet had the highest positive rates, all exceeding 20%. Only time was significantly associated with the level of surface contamination with SARS-CoV-2, showing a negative association. The decrease fit a first-order decay model with a decay rate of 0.77‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.07¬†day‚àí1, suggesting a 90% reduction in three days. Positive associations between the cumulative number of newly diagnosed patients in the same building and the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the public corridor were significant during the three days. Our results, in conjunction with the likely lower infectivity or viability, demonstrate that fomite transmission played a limited role in COVID-19 spread. The time determined SARS-CoV-2 RNA contamination, which was reduced by three days. This study is the first to show the decay patterns of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in real residential environments, providing insight into the patterns of transmission, as well as community-based prevention and control of similar threats.</p>

            <p>This research shows that using a genetically modified fungus can efficiently produce human monoclonal antibodies that effectively neutralize various SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, providing potential protection against different forms of the virus in both hamsters and non-human primates.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Monoclonal antibodies are an increasingly important tool for prophylaxis and treatment of acute virus infections like SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their use is often restricted due to the time required for development, variable yields and high production costs, as well as the need for adaptation to newly emerging virus variants. Here we use the genetically modified filamentous fungus expression systemThermothelomyces heterothallica(C1), which has a naturally high biosynthesis capacity for secretory enzymes and other proteins, to produce a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody (HuMab 87G7) that neutralises the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. Both the mammalian cell and C1 produced HuMab 87G7 broadly neutralise SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in vitro and also provide protection against VOC Omicron in hamsters. The C1 produced HuMab 87G7 is also able to protect against the Delta VOC in non-human primates. In summary, these findings show that the C1 expression system is a promising technology platform for the development of HuMabs in preventive and therapeutic medicine.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Blood transfusions from convalescent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients could be used to treat patients with severe infections or immunocompromised patients. However, it is necessary to select the optimal donors to maximize the utilization of resources. In this study, we investigated the associations among body mass index (BMI), tobacco smoking, exercise frequency and duration, and alcohol consumption with the SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibody titer levels with in the Chinese convalescent blood donor population. Here we show that BMI, smoking habits, and exercise frequency appear to be predictive factors for IgG levels in convalescent male blood donors. However, these variables were not observed as predictive of IgG levels in female convalescent blood donors. The findings could be used to optimize the screening for potential blood donors to treat immunocompromised or severely ill COVID-19 patients.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Serosurveys to monitor immunity toward COVID-19 in the population are primarily performed using an ELISA to screen samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, followed by confirmation by a virus neutralization test, which is considered the Gold Standard. However, virus neutralization test may not be feasible for some laboratories because of the requirement for specific facilities and trained personnel. In an attempt to address this limitation, we evaluated three cell-free methods as potential alternatives for assessing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in human population from plasma. We report the establishment of two inhibition ELISAs designed to detect anti-Spike RBD IgG antibodies and a microsphere quantitative suspension array technology assay, based on the Luminex xMAP platform, to measure the presence of antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including anti-RBD. These methods were also compared to a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay designed for anti-RBD antibodies detection and to the combined ELISA‚Äâ+‚Äâvirus neutralization test strategy. These cell-free assays performed equally to estimate the percentage of positive and negative samples and could be used to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human population, at least in cohort with high-expected prevalence, without the use of seroneutralization assay.</p>

            <p>In January 2024, several SARS-CoV-2 subvariants, including XBB, BA.2.86.1, and JN.1, account for over 80% of circulating variants; while these variants show different fitness levels and immune evasion properties, existing antivirals remain effective, and vaccines still offer some protection against infections.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The unceasing circulation of SARS-CoV-2 leads to the continuous emergence of novel viral sublineages. Here, we isolate and characterize XBB.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.16.1, EG.5.1.1, EG.5.1.3, XBF, BA.2.86.1 and JN.1 variants, representing >80% of circulating variants in January 2024. The XBB subvariants carry few but recurrent mutations in the spike, whereas BA.2.86.1 and JN.1 harbor >30 additional changes. These variants replicate in IGROV-1 but no longer in Vero E6 and are not markedly fusogenic. They potently infect nasal epithelial cells, with EG.5.1.3 exhibiting the highest fitness. Antivirals remain active. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses from vaccinees and BA.1/BA.2-infected individuals are markedly lower compared to BA.1, without major differences between variants. An XBB breakthrough infection enhances NAb responses against both XBB and BA.2.86 variants. JN.1 displays lower affinity to ACE2 and higher immune evasion properties compared to BA.2.86.1. Thus, while distinct, the evolutionary trajectory of these variants combines increased fitness and antibody evasion.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>We estimated the operating characteristics of ICD-10 code U07.1, introduced by the World Health Organization in 2020, to identify lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. CCEDRRN is a national research registry of adults (March 2020‚ÄìAugust 2021) with suspected/confirmed SARS-CoV-2 identified in Canadian emergency departments (EDs) using chart review (symptoms, clinical information, and lab test results including SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, PCR results). CCEDRRN data were linked to administrative hospitalization discharge and ED ICD-10 diagnostic codes (accessed centrally via the Canadian Institute for Health Information). We identified ICD-10 diagnostic codes in CCEDRRN participants. We defined lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 based on at least one positive PCR in the 0‚Äì14¬†days before the ED presentation and/or during hospitalization (in those admitted from ED). We performed separate analyses for CCEDRRN participants discharged from ED and those hospitalized from the ED. Additional analyses were stratified by province, sex, age, and (for hospitalized patients) timing of the first PCR test. The sensitivity of ICD-10 code U07.1 for a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 93.6% (95% CI 93.0‚Äì94.1%) in those hospitalized from ED and 83.0% (95% CI 82.1‚Äì83.9%) in those discharged from the ED. Sensitivity was similar across provinces and demographics, but in each stratified analysis, values were higher in those hospitalized versus those discharged from ED. The ICD-10 diagnostic code for U07.1 within administrative data identified most lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 within persons hospitalized from ED, although a significant number of cases discharged from ED were missed. This should be considered when using administrative data for research and public health planning.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that are capable of escaping vaccine-induced immunity highlights the urgency of developing new COVID-19 therapeutics. An essential mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human ACE2. Consequently, inhibiting this interaction becomes a highly promising therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrate that ACE2-expressing human lung spheroid cells (LSC)-derived exosomes (LSC-Exo) could function as a prophylactic agent to bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2, protecting the host against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhalation of LSC-Exo facilitates its deposition and biodistribution throughout the whole lung in a female mouse model. We show that LSC-Exo blocks the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host cells in vitro and in vivo by neutralizing the virus. LSC-Exo treatment protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2-induced disease and reduced viral loads. Furthermore, LSC-Exo intercepts the entry of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant pseudoviruses in female mice and shows comparable or equal potency against the wild-type strain, demonstrating that LSC-Exo may act as a broad-spectrum protectant against existing and emerging virus variants.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events, but the implications of vaccination for this increased risk are uncertain. With the approval of NHS England, we quantified associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and cardiovascular diseases in different vaccination and variant eras using linked electronic health records for ~40% of the English population. We defined a ‚Äòpre-vaccination‚Äô cohort (18,210,937 people) in the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô and ‚Äòunvaccinated‚Äô cohorts (13,572,399 and 3,161,485 people respectively) in the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We showed that the incidence of each arterial thrombotic, venous thrombotic and other cardiovascular outcomes was substantially elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19, compared with before or without COVID-19, but less markedly elevated in time periods beyond week 4. Hazard ratios were higher after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19 and higher in the pre-vaccination and unvaccinated cohorts than the vaccinated cohort. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of cardiovascular events after COVID-19 infection. People who had COVID-19 before or without being vaccinated are at higher risk of cardiovascular events for at least two years.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 often causes viral pneumonitis, hyperferritinemia, elevations in D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), transaminases, troponin, CRP, and other inflammatory markers. Lung ultrasound is increasingly used to diagnose and stratify viral pneumonitis severity. We retrospectively reviewed 427 visits in patients aged 14¬†days to 21¬†years who had had a point-of-care lung ultrasound in our pediatric emergency department from 30/November/2019 to 14/August/2021. Lung ultrasounds were categorized using a 6-point ordinal scale. Lung ultrasound abnormalities predicted increased hospitalization with a threshold effect. Increasingly abnormal laboratory values were associated with decreased discharge from the ED and increased admission to the ward and ICU. Among patients SARS-CoV-2 positive patients ferritin, LDH, and transaminases, but not CRP or troponin were significantly associated with abnormalities on lung ultrasound and also with threshold effects. This effect was not demonstrated in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. D-Dimer, CRP, and troponin were sometimes elevated even when the lung ultrasound was normal.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is known to participate in various host cellular processes, including interferon inhibition, RNA interference, apoptosis, and regulation of virus life cycles. Additionally, it has potential as a diagnostic antigen and/or immunogen. Our research focuses on examining structural changes caused by mutations in the N protein. We have modeled the complete tertiary structure of native and mutated forms of the N protein using Alphafold2. Notably, the N protein contains 3 disordered regions. The focus was on investigating the impact of mutations on the stability of the protein's dimeric structure based on binding free energy calculations (MM-PB/GB-SA) and RMSD fluctuations after MD simulations. The results demonstrated that 28 mutations out of 37 selected mutations analyzed, compared with wild-type N protein, resulted in a stable dimeric structure, while 9 mutations led to destabilization. Our results are important to understand the tertiary structure of the N protein dimer of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of mutations on it, their behavior in the host cell, as well as for the research of other viruses belonging to the same genus additionally, to anticipate potential strategies for addressing this viral illness‚Ä§</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In the ENSEMBLE randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (NCT04505722), estimated single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine efficacy (VE) was 56% against moderate to severe‚Äìcritical COVID-19.

In this set of prespecified analyses, we show that in Latin America, VE was significantly lower against Lambda vs. Reference and against Lambda vs. non-Lambda [family-wise error rate (FWER) p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05]. VE differed by residue match vs. mismatch to the vaccine-insert at 16 amino acid positions (4 FWER p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05; 12 q-value‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.20); significantly decreased with physicochemical-weighted Hamming distance to the vaccine-strain sequence for Spike, receptor-binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S1 (FWER p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001); differed (FWER‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ0.05) by distance to the vaccine strain measured by 9 antibody-epitope escape scores and 4 NTD neutralization-impacting features; and decreased (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.011) with neutralization resistance level to vaccinee sera. VE against severe‚Äìcritical COVID-19 was stable across most sequence features but lower against the¬†most distant viruses.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The expression of ACE2 is linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. The ACE2 receptor gene polymorphisms are considered determinants for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its outcome. In our study, serum ACE2 and its genetic variant S19P rs73635825 polymorphism were investigated in 114 SARS-CoV-2 patients. The results were compared with 120 control subjects. ELISA technique and allele discrimination assay were used for measuring serum ACE2 and genotype analysis of ACE2 rs73635825. Our results revealed that serum ACE2 was significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients (p‚Äâ=0.0001), particularly in cases with hypertension or diabetes mellitus. There was a significant difference in the genotype distributions of ACE2 rs73635825 A‚Äâ>‚ÄâG between COVID-19 patients and controls (p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). A higher frequency of the heterozygous AG genotype (65.8%) was reported in COVID-19 patients. The G allele was significantly more common in COVID-19 patients (p‚Äâ<0.0001). The AG and GG genotypes were associated with COVID-19 severity as they were correlated with abnormal laboratory findings, GGO, CXR, and total severity scores withp‚Äâ<0.05. Our results revealed that the ACE2 S19P gene variant is correlated with the incidence of infection and its severity, suggesting the usefulness of this work in identifying the susceptible population groups for better disease control.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) circulated cryptically before being identified as a threat, delaying interventions. Here we studied the drivers of such silent spread and its epidemic impact to inform future response planning. We focused on Alpha spread out of the UK. We integrated spatio-temporal records of international mobility, local epidemic growth and genomic surveillance into a Bayesian framework to reconstruct the first three months after Alpha emergence. We found that silent circulation lasted from days to months and decreased with the logarithm of sequencing coverage. Social restrictions in some countries likely delayed the establishment of local transmission, mitigating the negative consequences of late detection. Revisiting the initial spread of Alpha supports local mitigation at the destination in case of emerging events.</p>

            <p>This review investigates a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and autoimmune-driven neuropsychiatric manifestations involving NMDA receptors, but finds no significant evidence to support such a connection, emphasizing the need for continued research.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The global impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection has raised concerns about secondary diseases beyond acute illness. This review explores the significance and potential underlying mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 infection might elicit an immune response targeting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and its implications for autoimmune-driven neuropsychiatric manifestations. We identified 19 published case reports of NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination by a systematic literature search. The significance of these reports was limited since it is not clear if a coincidental or causal relationship exists between SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and manifestation of NMDA receptor encephalitis. The included studies were hampered by difficulties in establishing if these patients had pre-existing NMDA receptor antibodies which entered the brain by infection- or vaccination-associated transient blood-brain barrier leakage. In addition, four cases had comorbid ovarian teratoma, which is a known trigger for development of NMDA receptor encephalitis. Considering that billions of people have contracted COVID-19 or have been vaccinated against this virus, the publication of only 19 case reports with a possible link to NMDA receptor encephalitis, indicates that it is rare. In conclusion, these findings do not support the case that SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination led to an increase of existing or de novo encephalitis mediated by an autoimmune response targeting NMDA receptor function. Nevertheless, this work underscores the importance of ongoing vigilance in monitoring viral outbreaks and their potential impact on the central nervous system through basic, epidemiological and translational research.</p>

            <p>This research explores the design and characterization of various stability levels of spike proteins, finding that a highly stable spike protein with exposed conserved epitopes may be necessary to increase immunogenicity in future COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 induces neutralizing antibodies and is the key component of current COVID-19 vaccines. The most efficacious COVID-19 vaccines are genetically-encoded spikes with a double proline substitution in the hinge region to stabilize S in the prefusion conformation (S-2P). A subunit vaccine can be a valuable addition to mRNA and viral vector-based vaccines but requires high stability of spike. In addition, further stabilization of the prefusion conformation of spike might improve immunogenicity. To test this, five spike proteins were designed and characterized, ranging from low to high stability. The immunogenicity of these proteins was assessed in mice, demonstrating that a spike (S-closed-2) with a high melting temperature, which still allowed ACE2 binding, induced the highest neutralization titers against homologous and heterologous strains (up to 16-fold higher than the least stabilized spike). In contrast, the most stable spike variant (S-locked), in which the receptor binding domains (RBDs) were locked in a closed conformation and thus not able to breathe, induced relatively low neutralizing antibody titers against heterologous strains. These data demonstrate that S protein stabilization with RBDs exposing highly conserved epitopes may be needed to increase the immunogenicity of spike proteins for future COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Two types of immunity, humoral and cellular, offer protection against COVID. Humoral protection, contributed by circulating neutralizing antibodies, can provide immediate protection but decays more quickly than cellular immunity and can lose effectiveness in the face of mutation and drift in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Therefore, population-level seroprevalence surveys used to estimate population-level immunity may underestimate the degree to which a population is protected against COVID. In early 2021, before India began its vaccination campaign, we tested for humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-Cov-2 in representative samples of slum and non-slum populations in Bangalore, India. We found that 29.7% of samples (unweighted) had IgG antibodies to the spike protein and 15.5% had neutralizing antibodies, but at up to 46% showed evidence of cellular immunity. We also find that prevalence of cellular immunity is significantly higher in slums than in non-slums. These findings suggest (1) that a significantly larger proportion of the population in Bangalore, India, had cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 than had humoral immunity, as measured by serological surveys, and (2) that low socio-economic status communities display higher frequency of cellular immunity, likely because of greater exposure to infection due to population density.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The development of a vaccine specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Omicron has been hampered due to its low immunogenicity. Here, using reverse mutagenesis, we found that a phenylalanine-to-serine mutation at position 375 (F375S) in the spike protein of Omicron to revert it to the sequence found in Delta and other ancestral strains significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of Omicron vaccines. Sequence FAPFFAF at position 371‚Äì377 in Omicron spike had a potent inhibitory effect on macrophage uptake of receptor-binding domain (RBD) nanoparticles or spike-pseudovirus particles containing this sequence. Omicron RBD enhanced binding to Siglec-9 on macrophages to impair phagocytosis and antigen presentation and promote immune evasion, which could be abrogated by the F375S mutation.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evoked a worldwide pandemic. As the emergence of variants has hampered the neutralization capacity of currently available vaccines, developing effective antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants becomes a significant challenge. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 has received increased attention as an attractive pharmaceutical target because of its pivotal role in viral replication and proliferation. Here, we generated a de novo Mpro-inhibitor screening platform to evaluate the efficacies of Mproinhibitors based on Mprocleavage site-embedded amyloid peptide (MCAP)-coated gold nanoparticles (MCAP-AuNPs). We fabricated MCAPs comprising an amyloid-forming sequence and Mpro-cleavage sequence, mimicking in vivo viral replication process mediated by Mpro. By measuring the proteolytic activity of Mproand the inhibitory efficacies of various drugs, we confirmed that the MCAP-AuNP-based platform was suitable for rapid screening potential of Mproinhibitors. These results demonstrated that our MCAP-AuNP-based platform has great potential for discovering Mproinhibitors and may accelerate the development of therapeutics against COVID-19.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Increased recruitment of transitional and non-classical monocytes in the lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with COVID-19 severity. However, whether specific innate sensors mediate the activation or differentiation of monocytes in response to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 but not nucleoprotein induce differentiation of monocytes into transitional or non-classical subsets from both peripheral blood and COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples in a NFŒ∫B-dependent manner, but this process does not require inflammasome activation. However, NLRP3 and NLRC4 differentially regulated CD86 expression in monocytes in response to Spike 1 and Nucleoprotein, respectively. Moreover, monocytes exposed to Spike 1 induce significantly higher proportions of Th1 and Th17 CD4‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cells. In contrast, monocytes exposed to Nucleoprotein reduce the degranulation of CD8‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cells from severe COVID-19 patients. Our study provides insights in the differential impact of innate sensors in regulating monocytes in response to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which might be useful to better understand COVID-19 immunopathology and identify therapeutic targets.</p>

            <p>The research suggests that more frequent COVID-19 booster vaccinations, especially for older age groups and immunocompromised individuals, can effectively reduce severe COVID-19 cases, while younger populations may only benefit moderately; however, those with prior infection had lower benefits from frequent boosters.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>There is a public health need to understand how different frequencies of COVID-19 booster vaccines may mitigate the risk of severe COVID-19, while accounting for waning of protection and differential risk by age and immune status. By analyzing United States COVID-19 surveillance and seroprevalence data in a microsimulation model, here we show that more frequent COVID-19 booster vaccination (every 6‚Äì12 months) in older age groups and the immunocompromised population would effectively reduce the burden of severe COVID-19, while frequent boosters in the younger population may only provide modest benefit against severe disease. In persons 75+ years, the model estimated that annual boosters would reduce absolute annual risk of severe COVID-19 by 199 (uncertainty interval: 183‚Äì232) cases per 100,000 persons, compared to a one-time booster vaccination. In contrast, for persons 18‚Äì49 years, the model estimated that annual boosters would reduce this risk by 14 (10‚Äì19) cases per 100,000 persons. Those with prior infection had lower benefit of more frequent boosting, and immunocompromised persons had larger benefit. Scenarios with emerging variants with immune evasion increased the benefit of more frequent variant-targeted boosters. This study underscores the benefit of considering key risk factors to inform frequency of COVID-19 booster vaccines in public health guidance and ensuring at least annual boosters in high-risk populations.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This study reveals that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein disrupts the Rab7 GTP hydrolysis cycle, leading to hyperactivation of late endolysosomal and lysosomal pathways, benefiting viral replication while impairing biosynthetic transport of hydrolases to lysosomes, ultimately promoting viral egress.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, uses the host endolysosomal system for entry, replication, and egress. Previous studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virulence factor ORF3a interacts with the lysosomal tethering factor HOPS complex and blocks HOPS-mediated late endosome and autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to hyperactivation of the late endosomal and lysosomal small GTP-binding protein Rab7, which is dependent on ORF3a expression. We also observed Rab7 hyperactivation in naturally occurring ORF3a variants encoded by distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. We found that ORF3a, in complex with Vps39, sequesters the Rab7 GAP TBC1D5 and displaces Rab7 from this complex. Thus, ORF3a disrupts the GTP hydrolysis cycle of Rab7, which is beneficial for viral production, whereas the Rab7 GDP-locked mutant strongly reduces viral replication. Hyperactivation of Rab7 in ORF3a-expressing cells impaired CI-M6PR retrieval from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, disrupting the biosynthetic transport of newly synthesized hydrolases to lysosomes. Furthermore, the tethering of the Rab7- and Arl8b-positive compartments was strikingly reduced upon ORF3a expression. As SARS-CoV-2 egress requires Arl8b, these findings suggest that ORF3a-mediated hyperactivation of Rab7 serves a multitude of functions, including blocking endolysosome formation, interrupting the transport of lysosomal hydrolases, and promoting viral egress.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Wastewater surveillance has proven a cost-effective key public health tool to understand a wide range of community health diseases and has been a strong source of information on community levels and spread for health departments throughout the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic. Studies spanning the globe demonstrate the strong association between virus levels observed in wastewater and quality clinical case information of the population served by the sewershed. Few of these studies incorporate the temporal dependence present in sampling over time, which can lead to estimation issues which in turn impact conclusions. We contribute to the literature for this important public health science by putting forward time series methods coupled with statistical process control that (1) capture the evolving trend of a disease in the population; (2) separate the uncertainty in the population disease trend from the uncertainty due to sampling and measurement; and (3) support comparison of sub-sewershed population disease dynamics with those of the population represented by the larger downstream treatment plant. Our statistical methods incorporate the fact that measurements are over time, ensuring correct statistical conclusions. We provide a retrospective example of how sub-sewersheds virus levels compare to the upstream wastewater treatment plant virus levels. An on-line algorithm supports real-time statistical assessment of deviations of virus level in a population represented by a sub-sewershed to the virus level in the corresponding larger downstream wastewater treatment plant. This information supports public health decisions by spotlighting segments of the population where outbreaks may be occurring.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Vaccines based on mRNA technology have revolutionized the field. In fact, lipid nanoparticles (LNP) formulated with mRNA are the preferential vaccine platform used in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, with wider application against other diseases. The high demand and property right protection of the most potent cationic/ionizable lipids used for LNP formulation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have promoted the design of alternative nanocarriers for nucleic acid delivery. In this study we have evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of different rationally designed lipid and polymeric-based nanoparticle prototypes against SARS-CoV-2 infection. An mRNA coding for a trimeric soluble form of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein from SARS-CoV-2 was encapsulated using different components to form nanoemulsions (NE), nanocapsules (NC) and lipid nanoparticles (LNP). The toxicity and biological activity of these prototypes were evaluated in cultured cells after transfection and in mice following homologous prime/boost immunization. Our findings reveal good levels of RBD protein expression with most of the formulations. In C57BL/6 mice immunized intramuscularly with two doses of formulated RBD-mRNA, the modified lipid nanoparticle (mLNP) and the classical lipid nanoparticle (LNP-1) were the most effective delivery nanocarriers at inducing binding and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Both prototypes fully protected susceptible K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from morbidity and mortality following a SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These results highlight that modulation of mRNAs immunogenicity can be achieved by using alternative nanocarriers and support further assessment of mLNP and LNP-1 prototypes as delivery vehicles for mRNA vaccines.</p>

            <p>This research study found that primary healthcare workers in metropolitan France had a similar rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population, with risk factors being living in certain regions and having unprotected contact with a COVID-19 case within the household, rather than occupational factors.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Data on the SARS-CoV-2 infection among primary health care workers (PHCWs) are scarce but essential to reflect on policy regarding prevention and control measures. We assessed the prevalence of PHCWs who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with modeling from the general population in metropolitan France, and associated factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among general practitioners (GPs), pediatricians, dental and pharmacy workers in primary care between May and August 2021. Participants volunteered to provide a dried-blood spot for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assessment and completed a questionnaire. The primary outcome was defined as the detection of infection-induced antibodies (anti-nucleocapsid IgG, and for non-vaccinees: anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies) or previous self-reported infection (positive RT-qPCR or antigenic test, or positive ELISA test before vaccination). Estimates were adjusted using weights for representativeness and compared with prediction from the general population. Poisson regressions were used to quantify associated factors. The analysis included 1612 PHCWs. Weighted prevalences were: 31.7% (95% CI 27.5‚Äì36.0) for GPs, 28.7% (95% CI 24.4‚Äì33.0) for pediatricians, 25.2% (95% CI 20.6‚Äì31.0) for dentists, and 25.5% (95% CI 18.2‚Äì34.0) for pharmacists. Estimates were compatible with model predictions for the general population. PHCWs more likely to be infected were: GPs compared to pharmacist assistants (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.26; CI 95% 1.01‚Äì5.07), those living in √éle-de-France (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.53; CI 95% 1.14‚Äì2.05), South-East (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.57; CI 95% 1.19‚Äì2.08), North-East (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.81; CI 95% 1.38‚Äì2.37), and those having an unprotected contact with a COVID-19 case within the household (aPR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.48; CI 95% 1.22‚Äì1.80). Occupational factors were not associated with infection. In conclusion, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for PHCWs was more likely to have occurred in the community rather than at their workplace.</p>

            <p>The study found that airborne transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible, with 61% of participants emitting culture-positive aerosols smaller than 10 micrometers in size for up to nine days after symptoms began; a nasopharyngeal Ct value below 17 suggests a high likelihood of infectious aerosol generation and a specific blood biosignature is highly predictive.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol remains contentious. Importantly, whether cough or breath-generated bioaerosols can harbor viable and replicating virus remains largely unclarified. We performed size-fractionated aerosol sampling (Andersen cascade impactor) and evaluated viral culturability in human cell lines (infectiousness), viral genetics, and host immunity in ambulatory participants with COVID-19. Sixty-one percent (27/44) and 50% (22/44) of participants emitted variant-specific culture-positive aerosols <10Œºm and <5Œºm, respectively, for up to 9 days after symptom onset. Aerosol culturability is significantly associated with lower neutralizing antibody titers, and suppression of transcriptomic pathways related to innate immunity and the humoral response. A nasopharyngeal Ct <17 rules-in ~40% of aerosol culture-positives and identifies those who are probably highly infectious. A parsimonious three transcript blood-based biosignature is highly predictive of infectious aerosol generation (PPV‚Äâ>‚Äâ95%). There is considerable heterogeneity in potential infectiousness i.e., only 29% of participants were probably highly infectious (produced culture-positive aerosols <5Œºm at ~6 days after symptom onset). These data, which comprehensively confirm variant-specific culturable SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol, inform the targeting of transmission-related interventions and public health containment strategies emphasizing improved ventilation.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Many individuals who refuse COVID-19 vaccination have concerns about long-term side effects. Here, we report findings on self-reported symptoms from a Danish survey- and register study. The study included 34,868 vaccinated primary course recipients, 95.8% of whom received mRNA vaccines, and 1,568 unvaccinated individuals. Participants had no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using g-computation on logistic regression, risk differences (RDs) for symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons were estimated with adjustments for possible confounders. Within six weeks after vaccination, higher risks were observed for physical exhaustion (RD 4.9%, 95% CI 1.1% to 8.4%), fever or chills (RD 4.4%, 95% CI 2.1% to 6.7%), and muscle/joint pain (RD 7.0%, 95% CI 3.1% to 10.7%), compared to unvaccinated individuals. Beyond twenty-six weeks, risks were higher among the vaccinated for sleeping problems (RD 3.0, 95% 0.2 to 5.8), fever or chills (RD 2.0, 95% CI 0.4 to 3.6), reduced/altered taste (RD 1.2, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.3) and shortness of breath (RD 2.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 4.0). However, when examining pre-omicron responses only, the difference for reduced/altered taste was significant. As expected, the risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, fever or chills, and muscle/joint pain was higher among persons who responded within six weeks of completing the primary course. No significant differences were observed for the 7-25-week period after vaccination. Associations for the period beyond 26 weeks must be interpreted with caution and in the context of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection, wide confidence intervals, and multiple testing. Overall, we observe no concerning signs of long-term self-reported physical, cognitive, or fatigue symptoms after vaccination.</p>

            <p>This study found that four Omicron lineages circulated among children between December 2021 and November 2022, with most infections occurring in those under one year old; additionally, the presence of certain genetic variations was associated with moderate/severe COVID-19 cases.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron clade has shown a marked degree of variability and different clinical presentation compared with previous clades. Here we demonstrate that at least four Omicron lineages circulated in children since December 2021, and studied until November 2022: BA.1 (33.6%), BA.2 (40.6%), BA.5 (23.7%) and BQ.1 (2.1%). At least 70% of infections concerned children under 1¬†year, most of them being infected with BA.2 lineages (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ201, 75.6%). Looking at SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability, 69 SNPs were found to be significantly associated in pairs, (phi‚Äâ<‚Äâ‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ0.3 or‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.3 and p-value‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). 16 SNPs were involved in 4 distinct clusters (bootstrap‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.75). One of these clusters (A23040G, A27259C, T23617G, T23620G) was also positively associated with moderate/severe COVID-19 presentation (AOR [95% CI] 2.49 [1.26‚Äì4.89] p-value: 0.008) together with comorbidities (AOR [95% CI] 2.67 [1.36‚Äì5.24] p-value: 0.004). Overall, these results highlight the extensive SARS-CoV-2 Omicron circulation in children, mostly aged‚Äâ<‚Äâ1¬†year, and provide insights on viral diversification even considering low-abundant SNPs, finally suggesting the potential contribution of viral diversification in affecting disease severity.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 into a seasonal pathogen along with the emergence of new variants, underscores the need for dynamic and adaptable responses, emphasizing the importance of sustained vaccination strategies. This observer-blind, double-dummy, randomized immunobridging phase 2 study (NCT05175742) aimed to compare the immunogenicity induced by two doses of 40¬†Œºg PTX-COVID19-B vaccine candidate administered 28¬†days apart, with the response induced by two doses of 30¬†¬µg Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2), administered 21¬†days apart, in Nucleocapsid-protein seronegative adults 18‚Äì64¬†years of age. Both vaccines were administrated via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. Two weeks after the second dose, the neutralizing antibody (NAb) geometric mean titer ratio and seroconversion rate met the non-inferiority criteria, successfully achieving the primary immunogenicity endpoints of the study. PTX-COVID19-B demonstrated similar safety and tolerability profile to BNT162b2 vaccine. The lowest NAb response was observed in subjects with low-to-undetectable NAb at baseline or no reported breakthrough infection. Conversely, participants who experienced breakthrough infections during the study exhibited higher NAb titers. This study also shows induction of cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses by PTX-COVID19-B. In conclusion, the vaccine candidate PTX-COVID19-B demonstrated favourable safety profile along with immunogenicity similar to the active comparator BNT162b2 vaccine.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emphasized the need to explore how variations in the immune system relate to the severity of the disease. This study aimed to explore inter-individual variation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing T cell, B cell, and innate cell immune subsets among primary infected children and adults (i.e., those who had never experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection nor received vaccination previously), with varying disease severity after infection. We also examined immune subset kinetics in convalescent individuals compared to those with persistent infection to identify possible markers of immune dysfunction. Distinct immune subset differences were observed between infected adults and children, as well as among adult cases with mild, moderate, and severe disease. IgM memory B cells were absent in moderate and severe cases whereas frequencies of B cells with a lack of surface immunoglobulin expression were significantly higher in severe cases. Interestingly, these immune subsets remained stable during recovery implying that these subsets could be associated with underlying baseline immune variation. Our results offer insights into the potential immune markers associated with severe COVID-19 and provide a foundation for future research in this area.</p>

            <p>This study found that defects in iron homeostasis, dysregulated erythropoiesis, and immune dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection might contribute to persistent symptoms, or PASC, and could potentially be targeted for treatment.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection are increasingly reported, although the drivers of post-acute sequelae (PASC) of COVID-19 are unclear. Here we assessed 214 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, with varying disease severity, for one year from COVID-19 symptom onset to determine the early correlates of PASC. A multivariate signature detected beyond two weeks of disease, encompassing unresolving inflammation, anemia, low serum iron, altered iron-homeostasis gene expression and emerging stress erythropoiesis; differentiated those who reported PASC months later, irrespective of COVID-19 severity. A whole-blood heme-metabolism signature, enriched in hospitalized patients at month 1‚Äì3 post onset, coincided with pronounced iron-deficient reticulocytosis. Lymphopenia and low numbers of dendritic cells persisted in those with PASC, and single-cell analysis reported iron maldistribution, suggesting monocyte iron loading and increased iron demand in proliferating lymphocytes. Thus, defects in iron homeostasis, dysregulated erythropoiesis and immune dysfunction due to COVID-19 possibly contribute to inefficient oxygen transport, inflammatory disequilibrium and persisting symptomatology, and may be therapeutically tractable.</p>

            <p>This study found that after 6 months, around 36% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia still had lung damage and nearly 15% had fibrotic changes; factors like age, invasive ventilation, and smoking increased the likelihood of these outcomes.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>This study aimed to assess pulmonary changes at 6-month follow-up CT and predictors of pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes in COVID-19 pneumonia patients in China following relaxation of COVID restrictions in 2022. A total of 271 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between November 29, 2022 and February 10, 2023 were prospectively evaluated at 6¬†months. CT characteristics and Chest CT scores of pulmonary abnormalities were compared between the initial and the 6-month CT. The association of demographic and clinical factors with CT residual abnormalities or fibrotic-like changes were assessed using logistic regression. Follow-up CT scans were obtained at a median of 177¬†days (IQR, 170‚Äì185¬†days) after hospital admission. Pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes were found in 98 (36.2%) and 39 (14.4%) participants. In multivariable analysis of pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes, the top three predictive factors were invasive ventilation (OR 13.6; 95% CI 1.9, 45; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ.001), age‚Äâ>‚Äâ60¬†years (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3, 39; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01), paxlovid (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.04, 0.48; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01) and invasive ventilation (OR 10.3; 95% CI 2.9, 33; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.002), paxlovid (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.03, 0.48; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01), smoker (OR 9.9; 95% CI 2.4, 31; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01), respectively.  The 6-month follow-up CT of recent COVID-19 pneumonia cases in China showed a considerable proportion of the patients with pulmonary residual abnormalities and fibrotic-like changes. Antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 like paxlovid may be beneficial for long-term regression of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Post-COVID-19 syndrome may be associated with the abnormal immune status. Compared with the unexposed age-matched elder group, PD-1 in the CD8+T cells from recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly lower. IFN-Œ≥ in the plasma of COVID-19 convalescent patients was increased, which inhibited PD-1 expression in CD8+T cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients. scRNA-seq bioinformatics analysis revealed that AKT/GSK3Œ≤ may regulate the INF-Œ≥/PD-1 axis in CD8+T cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients. In parallel, an IFN-Œ≥ neutralizing antibody reduced AKT and increased GSK3Œ≤ in PBMCs. An AKT agonist (SC79) significantly decreased p-GSK3Œ≤. Moreover, AKT decreased PD-1 on CD8+T cells, and GSK3Œ≤ increased PD-1 on CD8+T cells according to flow cytometry analysis. Collectively, we demonstrated that recovered COVID-19 patients may develop long COVID. Increased IFN-Œ≥ in the plasma of recovered Wuhan COVID-19 patients contributed to PD-1 downregulation on CD8+T cells by regulating the AKT/GSK3Œ≤ signaling pathway.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a serious complication following SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized primarily by fatigue and cognitive complaints. Although first metabolic and structural imaging alterations in Post-COVID-19 syndrome have been identified, their functional consequences remain unknown. Thus, we explored the impact of Post-COVID-19 syndrome on the functional connectome of the brain providing a deeper understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. In a cross-sectional observational study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 66 patients with Post-COVID-19 syndrome after mild infection (mean age 42.3 years, 57 female) and 57 healthy controls (mean age 42.1 years, 38 female) with a mean time of seven months after acute COVID-19 were analysed using a graph theoretical approach. Network features were quantified using measures including mean distance, nodal degree, betweenness and Katz centrality, and compared between both groups. Graph measures were correlated with clinical measures quantifying fatigue, cognitive function, affective symptoms and sleep disturbances. Alterations were mainly found in the brainstem, olfactory cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus and cerebellum on average seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, strong correlations between fatigue severity, cognitive functioning and daytime sleepiness from clinical scales and graph measures were observed. Our study confirms functional relevance of brain imaging changes in Post-COVID-19 syndrome as mediating factors for persistent symptoms and improves our pathophysiological understanding.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The XBB.1.5 variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly achieved global dominance and exhibits a high growth advantage over previous variants. Preliminary reports suggest that the success of XBB.1.5 stems from mutations within its spike glycoprotein, causing immune evasion and enhanced receptor binding. We present receptor binding studies that demonstrate retention of binding contacts with the human ACE2 receptor and a striking decrease in binding to mouse ACE2 due to the revertant R493Q mutation. Despite extensive evasion of antibody binding, we highlight a region on the XBB.1.5 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) that is recognized by serum antibodies from a donor with hybrid immunity, collected prior to the emergence of the XBB.1.5 variant. T cell assays reveal high frequencies of XBB.1.5 spike-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells amongst donors with hybrid immunity, with the CD4+T cells skewed towards a Th1 cell phenotype and having attenuated effector cytokine secretion as compared to ancestral spike protein-specific cells. Thus, while the XBB.1.5 variant has retained efficient human receptor binding and gained antigenic alterations, it remains susceptible to recognition by T cells induced via vaccination and previous infection.</p>

            <p>This research explored public perception on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to lower SARS-CoV-2 transmission, finding that mask-wearing and outdoor meetings are most influential in reducing risk, while physical distancing has less impact.

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>We conduct a large (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ6567) online experiment to measure the features of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that citizens of six European countries perceive to lower the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2 the most. We collected data in Bulgaria (n=‚Äâ1069), France (n=‚Äâ1108), Poland (n=‚Äâ1104), Italy (n=‚Äâ1087), Spain (n=‚Äâ1102) and Sweden (n=‚Äâ1097). Based on the features of the most widely adopted public health guidelines to reduce SARS-Cov-2 transmission (mask wearing vs not, outdoor vs indoor contact, short vs 90¬†min meetings, few vs many people present, and physical distancing of 1 or 2 m), we conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to estimate the public‚Äôs perceived risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in scenarios that presented mutually exclusive constellations of these features. Our findings indicate that participants‚Äô perception of transmission risk was most influenced by the NPI attributes of mask-wearing and outdoor meetings and the least by NPI attributes that focus on physical distancing, meeting duration, and meeting size. Differentiating by country, gender, age, cognitive style (reflective or intuitive), and perceived freight of COVID-19 moreover allowed us to identify important differences between subgroups. Our findings highlight the importance of improving health policy communication and citizens‚Äô health literacy about the design of NPIs and the transmission risk of SARS-Cov-2 and potentially future viruses.</p>

            <p>This study analyzed 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Latin America and Caribbean regions between February 2020 and March 2022 to understand the spread of COVID-19 variants and their connection with human mobility patterns.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regions were an important epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Through the COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Regional Network (COVIGEN), LAC countries produced an important number of genomic sequencing data that made possible an enhanced SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance capacity in the Americas, paving the way for characterization of emerging variants and helping to guide the public health response. In this study we analyzed approximately 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated between February 2020 and March 2022 by multiple genomic surveillance efforts in LAC and reconstructed the diffusion patterns of the main variants of concern (VOCs) and of interest (VOIs) possibly originated in the Region. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the spread of variants Gamma, Lambda and Mu reflects human mobility patterns due to variations of international air passenger transportation and gradual lifting of social distance measures previously implemented in countries. Our results highlight the potential of genetic data to reconstruct viral spread and unveil preferential routes of viral migrations that are shaped by human mobility patterns.</p>

            <p>This study found that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a stabilized Spike glycoprotein (S-29) provided partial protection against weight loss, but reduced efficacy was observed in geriatric animals, emphasizing the need for testing vaccine effectiveness in older animals during preclinical evaluation.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Age is associated with reduced efficacy of vaccines and linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Here we determined the impact of ageing on the efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a stabilised Spike glycoprotein (S-29) that had previously shown high efficacy in young animals. Thirteen to 18-month-old golden Syrian hamsters (GSH) and 22‚Äì23-month-old K18-hCAE2 mice were immunised twice with S-29 protein in AddaVaxTMadjuvant. GSH were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 either two weeks or four months after the booster dose, while all K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally inoculated two weeks after the second immunisation. Body weight and clinical signs were recorded daily post-inoculation. Lesions and viral load were investigated in different target tissues. Immunisation induced seroconversion and production of neutralising antibodies; however, animals were only partially protected from weight loss. We observed a significant reduction in the amount of viral RNA and a faster viral protein clearance in the tissues of immunized animals. Infectious particles showed a faster decay in vaccinated animals while tissue lesion development was not altered. In GSH, the shortest interval between immunisation and inoculation reduced RNA levels in the lungs, while the longest interval was equally effective in reducing RNA in nasal turbinates; viral nucleoprotein amount decreased in both tissues. In mice, immunisation was able to improve the survival of infected animals. Despite the high protection shown in young animals, S-29 efficacy was reduced in the geriatric population. Our research highlights the importance of testing vaccine efficacy in older animals as part of preclinical vaccine evaluation.</p>

            <p>This study found that COVID-19 vaccine side effects, particularly local ones, were common among participants in six Arabic countries, with factors such as age and gender influencing the frequency of side effects; further research is needed to better understand the safety of different vaccines.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a major challenge worldwide for the past years with high morbidity and mortality rates. While vaccination was the cornerstone to control the pandemic and disease spread, concerns regarding safety and adverse events (AEs) have been raised lately. A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1st and January 22nd, 2022, in six Arabic countries namely Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Algeria. We utilized a self-administered questionnaire validated in Arabic which encompassed two main parts. The first was regarding sociodemographic data while the second was about COVID-19 vaccination history, types, doses, and experienced AEs. A multistage sampling was employed in each country, involving the random selection of three governorates from each country, followed by the selection of one urban area and one rural area from each governorate. We included the responses of 1564 participants. The most common AEs after the first and second doses were local AEs (67.9% and 46.6%, respectively) followed by bone pain and myalgia (37.6% and 31.8%, respectively). After the third dose, the most common AEs were local AEs (45.7%) and fever (32.4%). Johnson and Johnson, Sputnik Light, and Moderna vaccines showed the highest frequency of AEs. Factors associated with AEs after the first dose included an increase in age (aOR of 61‚Äì75 years compared to the 12‚Äì18 years group: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.59‚Äì4.25, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001) and male gender (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63‚Äì0.82, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The cumulative post-vaccination COVID-19 disease was reported with Sinovac (16.1%), Sinopharm (15.8%), and Johnson and Johnson (14.9) vaccines. History of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increases the risk of post-vaccination COVID-19 after the first, second, and booster doses (OR: 3.09, CI: 1.9‚Äì5.07, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001; OR: 2.56, CI: 1.89‚Äì3.47, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001; and OR: 2.94, CI: 1.6‚Äì5.39, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0005 respectively). In conclusion, AEs were common among our participants, especially local AEs. Further extensive studies are needed to generate more generalizable data regarding the safety of different vaccines.</p>

            <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>This study found that liver transplant recipients are less responsive to mRNA vaccines due to immunosuppression, but a third vaccine dose can improve both humoral responses and spike-specific CD4+T-cell responses in these patients. However, it does not provide a booster effect for spike-specific memory CD8+T-cell responses.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>Liver transplant recipients (LTRs) are at a high risk of severe COVID-19 owing to immunosuppression and comorbidities. LTRs are less responsive to mRNA vaccines than healthy donors (HDs) or other immunosuppressed patients. However, the disruption mechanism in humoral and cellular immune memory responses is unclear. We longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma samples from HDs (n=‚Äâ44) and LTRs (n=‚Äâ54) who received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. We measured the levels of anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies and spike-specific CD4+and CD8+T-cell responses. Here, we show that the induction of anti-RBD IgG was weaker in LTRs than in HDs. The use of multiple immunosuppressive drugs is associated with lower antibody titers than only calcineurin inhibitor, and limits the induction of CD4+T-cell responses. However, spike-specific CD4+T-cell and antibody responses improved with a third vaccination. Furthermore, mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific CD8+T¬†cells are quantitatively, but not qualitatively, limited to LTRs. Both CD4+and CD8+T¬†cells react to omicron sublineages, regardless of the presence in HDs or LTRs. However, there is no boosting effect of spike-specific memory CD8+T-cell responses after a third vaccination in HDs or LTRs. The third mRNA vaccination improves both humoral responses and spike-specific CD4+T-cell responses in LTRs but provides no booster effect for spike-specific memory CD8+T-cell responses. A third mRNA vaccination could be helpful in LTRs to prevent severe COVID-19, although further investigation is required to elicit CD8+T-cell responses in LTRs and HDs.</p>

            <p>This research found that COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risk of long-term health issues, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality for those infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong, especially when individuals are fully vaccinated or have received a booster dose.</p>
            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The persisting risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the protection against such risk conferred by COVID-19 vaccination remains unclear. Here we conducted a retrospective territory-wide cohort study on 1,175,277 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by their vaccination status and non-infected controls to evaluate the risk of clinical sequelae, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality using a territory-wide public healthcare database with population-based vaccination records in Hong Kong. A progressive reduction in risk of all-cause mortality was observed over one year between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and controls. Patients with complete vaccination or have received booster dose incurred a lower risk of health consequences including major cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality than unvaccinated or patients with incomplete vaccination 30-90 days after infection. Completely vaccinated and patients with booster dose of vaccines did not incur significant higher risk of health consequences from 271 and 91 days of infection onwards, respectively, whilst un-vaccinated and incompletely vaccinated patients continued to incur a greater risk of clinical sequelae for up to a year following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provided real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its persistence following infection.</p>

            <br><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a public health crisis.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Panbio and STANDARD Q COVID-19 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) against the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at one of the largest hospitals in southern Ethiopia. Nasopharyngeal samples, which were collected during the pandemic from individuals suspected of COVID-19 and stored at ‚àí¬†70¬†¬∞C, were analyzed in June and July 2022. The performance of the Panbio COVID-19 antigen tests was evaluated in 200 randomly selected nasopharyngeal samples (100 positives and 100 negatives for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 by¬†RT-PCR). The STANDARD Q test was evaluated using 100 positive and 50 negative samples. The respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 88%, 99%, 98.9% and 89.2% for the Panbio test and 91%, 98%, 98.9% and 84.5%, for the STANDARD Q test. The kappa values were 0.87 for the Panbio and 0.86 for the STANDARD Q test. Based on the findings presented here, the RDTs could be utilized as an alternative to conventional RT-PCR when it is challenging to diagnose COVID-19 owing to a lack of time, skilled lab personnel, or¬†suitable equipment or electricity.</p>
