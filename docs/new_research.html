                <p>A colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification method targeting the L452R mutation to detect the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2</p><br>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

A new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly around the world, causing problems for people and economies. A variant of this virus, known as Delta, is still widespread and can make COVID-19 vaccines less effective. To control the spread of the virus, scientists need to be able to detect it quickly.

This study developed a new test that can specifically identify the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. The test uses a color-changing reaction to show whether someone has the virus or not. When tested with 126 real samples, the test was highly accurate and sensitive, making it a useful tool for tracking COVID-19 and developing strategies to control its spread in the future.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered global difficulties for both individuals and economies, with new variants continuing to emerge. The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 remains most prevalent worldwide, and it affects the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Expedited testing to detect the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 and monitor viral transmission is necessary. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique targeting the L452R mutation in the S gene for the specific detection of the Delta variant. In the test, positivity was indicated as a color change from purple to yellow. The assay‚Äôs 95% limit of detection was 57 copies per reaction for the L452R (U1355G)-specific standard plasmid. Using 126 clinical samples, our assay displayed 100% specificity, 97.06% sensitivity, and 98.41% accuracy in identifying the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 compared to real-time RT-PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first colorimetric RT-LAMP assay that can differentiate the Delta variant from its generic SARS-CoV-2, enabling it as an approach for studying COVID-19 demography and facilitating proper effective control measure establishment to fight against the reemerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.</p>

                <p>Mpox infection of stromal cells and macrophages of macaque with endometriosis</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The mpox outbreak in 2022-2023 was a new health problem that showed mpox can be spread through sex, though it mostly affected men who have sex with other men (MSM). Women are also at risk, especially during pregnancy.

We studied some monkeys to see how they got infected. We found that mpox didn't just live in their skin - it was also inside the vagina and uterus of the monkeys.

The study showed mpox could grow in special tissue called endometriosis. This is a condition where tissue like what grows in your uterus but is found elsewhere, usually on other organs like the ovaries. 

We learned that mpox likes to live in certain types of cells - specifically ones that help protect against infections and some of the cells inside the reproductive system.

The study also suggested women with this condition might be more at risk for bad things happening if they get mpox.

In general, this research shows us what happens when a disease like mpox affects the genital area. The monkeys were used because they're similar to humans in many ways and can help understand how diseases work.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The mpox outbreak of 2022‚Äì2023 represented a new global health challenge and recognition of mpox as a sexually transmitted disease. The majority of cases were reported in men who have sex with men (MSM), but women are also susceptible, especially during pregnancy. We evaluated the reproductive tracts of a subset of macaques from a large rechallenge study of mpox infection with virus from the 2022 outbreak and identified intraabdominal mpox replication associated with endometriosis. Mpox virus (MPXV) was found not only in skin, but in the cervix, the uterus, and periovarian endometriotic lesions of the affected macaque. Mpox replication preferentially targeted vimentin-positive poorly differentiated endometriotic stromal tissue and infiltrating macrophages in the reproductive tract. Mpox tropism for stromal cells and macrophages has broad implications for mpox pathogenesis and associated clinical syndromes. In addition, women with endometriosis may be at heightened risk for adverse outcomes associated with mpox infection. The rhesus macaque provides rare insight into this disease and the potential complications of mpox infection in the context of genitourinary tract disease.</p>

                <p>Shared neutrophil and T cell dysfunction is accompanied by a distinct interferon signature during severe febrile illnesses in children</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>This abstract is about studying how the body's immune system reacts differently when kids get very sick from various illnesses, like coronavirus or bacterial infections. They looked at blood samples from 74 kids with a condition called MIS-C (which happens after they had COVID), 30 with bacterial infections, 16 with viral infections, and 8 with Kawasaki disease. 

They found that in most cases, the body's neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) were overreacting or dying too quickly. They also noticed that T cells from kids with MIS-C and bacterial infections didn't work as well as they should.

For viral infections like those from viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, their immune system showed less response to interferons, which are important for fighting off infections. This finding could help doctors figure out better ways to treat very sick children who have these illnesses.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Severe febrile illnesses in children encompass life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by diverse pathogens and other severe inflammatory syndromes. A comparative approach to these illnesses may identify shared and distinct features of host immune dysfunction amenable to immunomodulation. Here, using immunophenotyping with mass cytometry and cell stimulation experiments, we illustrate trajectories of immune dysfunction in 74 children with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2, 30 with bacterial infection, 16 with viral infection, 8 with Kawasaki disease, and 42 controls. We explore these findings in a secondary cohort of 500 children with these illnesses and 134 controls. We show that neutrophil activation and apoptosis are prominent in multi-system inflammatory syndrome, and that this is partially shared with bacterial infection. We show that memory T cells from patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome and bacterial infection are exhausted. In contrast, we show viral infection to be characterized by a distinct signature of decreased interferon signaling and lower interferon receptor gene expression. Improved understanding of immune dysfunction may improve approaches to immunomodulator therapy in severe febrile illnesses in children.</p>

                <p>Emergence of transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants with decreased sensitivity to antivirals in immunocompromised patients with persistent infections</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

We studied how antiviral treatments affect the COVID-19 virus in people with weakened immune systems. Fifteen patients were given different treatments, including remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, to see if the virus developed resistance.

The results showed that nine out of 15 patients had viruses with mutations that made them harder to treat. We isolated a COVID-19 virus from one patient that was resistant to two common antiviral medications: remdesivir and nirmatrelvir.

This study is important because it shows that the virus can develop resistance to these treatments, even after prolonged use. The infected virus was also shown to be transmissible to other animals in a lab experiment.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>We investigated the impact of antiviral treatment on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 resistance during persistent infections in immunocompromised patients (n=‚Äâ15). All patients received remdesivir and some also received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n=‚Äâ3) or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (n=‚Äâ4). Sequence analysis showed that nine patients carried viruses with mutations in the nsp12 (RNA dependent RNA polymerase), while four had viruses with nsp5 (3C protease) mutations. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 with a double mutation in nsp5 (T169I) and nsp12 (V792I) was recovered from respiratory secretions 77 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis from a patient sequentially¬†treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir¬†and remdesivir. In vitro characterization confirmed its decreased sensitivity to remdesivir and nirmatrelvir, which was overcome by combined antiviral treatment. Studies in golden Syrian hamsters demonstrated efficient transmission to contact animals. This study documents the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 carrying resistance mutations to both nirmatrelvir and remdesivir from a patient and demonstrates its transmissibility in vivo.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

The COVID-19 vaccine needs two types of help from our immune system: special cells called T cells that can recognize and attack the virus, and antibodies that neutralize it. Our previous research showed that using a special delivery system called pullulan nanogel (PNG) could make these T cells stronger. We found out that PNG works by binding to a specific receptor on certain immune cells in our lymph nodes.

In this study, we tested if using PNG with a part of the COVID-19 virus's spike protein as the vaccine could help protect against infection. In mice with COVID-19-like symptoms, we saw that the vaccine decreased the viral load and helped them survive longer. We also found out that even low-frequency T cells that responded quickly to the virus were important for clearing the virus.

Overall, our study suggests that targeting specific immune cells in the lymph nodes can help make vaccines more effective by inducing strong T cell responses.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Vaccine-induced T cells and neutralizing antibodies are essential for protection against SARS-CoV-2. Previously, we demonstrated that an antigen delivery system, pullulan nanogel (PNG), delivers vaccine antigen to lymph node medullary macrophages and thereby enhances the induction of specific CD8+T cells. In this study, we revealed that medullary macrophage-selective delivery by PNG depends on its binding to a C-type lectin SIGN-R1. In a K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination with a PNG-encapsulated receptor-binding domain of spike protein decreased the viral load and prolonged the survival in the CD8+T cell- and B cell-dependent manners. T cell receptor repertoire analysis revealed that although the vaccine induced T cells at various frequencies, low-frequency specific T cells mainly promoted virus clearance. Thus, the induction of specific CD8+T cells that respond quickly to viral infection, even at low frequencies, is important for vaccine efficacy and can be achieved by SIGN-R1+medullary macrophage-targeted antigen delivery.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract that a young person can understand:

Scientists are trying to find new ways to stop COVID-19 from spreading. They've discovered that a protein called ACTN4 plays a crucial role in this process. When ACTN4 is reduced, it makes it harder for COVID-19 to multiply inside cells.

Researchers also found two substances, YS-49 and demethyl-coclaurine, that can block COVID-19 infection. These substances work by targeting the protein that helps COVID-19 replicate.

This study shows how important ACTN4 is in stopping COVID-19 from spreading and reveals new potential candidates for developing medicines to fight against the virus.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The various mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose a substantial challenge in mitigating the viral infectivity. The identification of novel host factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 replication holds potential for discovering new targets for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that can combat future viral mutations. In this study, potential host factors regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened through different high-throughput sequencing techniques and further identified in cells. Subsequent analysis and experiments showed that the reduction of m6A modification level onACTN4(Alpha-actinin-4) mRNA leads to a decrease in mRNA stability and translation efficiency, ultimately inhibiting ACTN4 expression. In addition, ACTN4 was demonstrated to target nsp12 for binding and characterized as a competitor for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, thereby impeding viral replication. Furthermore, two ACTN4 agonists, YS-49 and demethyl-coclaurine, were found to dose-dependently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in both Huh7 cells and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Collectively, this study unveils the pivotal role of ACTN4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering novel insights into the intricate interplay between the virus and host cells, and reveals two potential candidates for future anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Scientists found that a type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 can infect domestic cats and even wild animals. They wanted to know if cats play a role in spreading this virus, so they did experiments on cats to see how well it spreads and how their bodies react.

The results showed that cats are very susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can spread it for up to 7 days after being infected. However, one type of the virus, called Omicron, didn't spread as well in cat tissues and caused less severe symptoms. The study also found that cats' bodies produced antibodies to fight off the virus.

This suggests that while cats might be able to catch SARS-CoV-2, they're not very good at spreading it around, especially with the Omicron variant.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected or isolated from domestic cats. It is unclear whether cats play an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission cycle. In this study, we examined the susceptibility of cats to SARS-CoV-2, including wild type and variants, by animal experiments. Cats inoculated with wild type, gamma, and delta variants secreted a large amount of SARS-CoV-2 for 1¬†week after the inoculation from nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal routes. Only 100 TCID50of virus could infect cats and replicate well without severe clinical symptoms. In addition, one cat inoculated with wild type showed persistent virus secretion in feces for over 28¬†days post-inoculation (dpi). The titer of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 increased from 11 dpi, reaching a peak at 14 dpi. However, the omicron variant could not replicate well in cat tissues and induced a lower titer of VN antibodies. It is concluded that cats were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not to the Omicron Variant, which caused the attenuated pathogenicity.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Researchers studied people who had COVID-19 to see how it affects their bodies, especially in their mouths and throats. They collected saliva and blood samples from 45 people and looked for signs of the virus and how their immune system responded.

They found that most people with COVID-19 had the virus in their saliva and throat wash for up to 4 weeks after getting sick. Some people even showed signs of the virus in their saliva when they didn't have symptoms anymore.

The researchers also discovered that people who were severely ill with COVID-19 tended to have more antibodies (which fight off infections) in their blood and saliva, especially in the early stages of the illness. They found that some people's immune system responded differently based on their sex, with women having higher levels of certain antibodies in their saliva.

The study suggests that the virus can replicate (multiply) in the mouth and throat for a while after symptoms go away, which may be important for understanding how COVID-19 is transmitted to others. The researchers also found evidence that some people's immune system may "confuse" the virus with other proteins in their body, which could affect how well they fight off the infection.

Overall, this study provides new insights into how COVID-19 affects the body and may help us understand more about the disease and how to prevent it from spreading.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Oral fluids provide ready detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and host responses. This study sought to evaluate relationships between oral virus, oral and systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, and symptoms. Oral fluids (saliva/throat wash (saliva/TW)) and serum were collected from asymptomatic and symptomatic, nasopharyngeal (NP) SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR+‚Äâhuman participants (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ45). SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and N-antigen detection by immunoblot and lateral flow assay (LFA) were performed. RT-qPCR for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) was sequence confirmed. SARS-CoV-2-anti-S protein RBD LFA and ELISA assessed IgM and IgG responses. Structural analysis identified host salivary molecules analogous to SARS-CoV-2-N-antigen. At time of enrollment (baseline, BL), LFA-detected N-antigen in 86% of TW and was immunoblot-confirmed. However, only 3/17 were saliva/TW qPCR+‚Äâ. Sixty percent of saliva and 83% of TW demonstrated persistent N-antigen at 4¬†weeks. N-antigen LFA signal in three anti-spike sero-negative participants suggested potential cross-detection of 4 structurally analogous salivary RNA binding proteins (alignment 19‚Äì29aa, RMSD 1‚Äì1.5 Angstroms). At enrollment, symptomatic participants demonstrated replication-associated sgRNA junctions, were IgG+‚Äâ(94%/100% in saliva/TW), and IgM+‚Äâ(63%/54%). At 4¬†weeks, SARS-CoV-2 IgG (100%/83%) and IgM (80%/67%) persisted. Oral and serum IgG correlated 100% with NP+‚ÄâPCR status. Cough and fatigue severity (p=‚Äâ0.010 and 0.018 respectively), and presence of weakness, nausea, and composite upper respiratory symptoms (p=‚Äâ0.037, 0.005, and 0.017, respectively) were negatively associated with saliva IgM but not TW or serum IgM. Throat wash IgM levels were higher in women compared to men, although the association did not reach statistical significance (median: 290 (female) versus 0.697,p=‚Äâ0.056). Important to transmission and disease course, oral viral replication and persistence showed clear relationships with select symptoms and early oral IgM responses during early infection. N-antigen cross-reactivity may reflect mimicry of structurally analogous host proteins.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Researchers studied how a deficiency in a certain receptor (Tlr7) affects the severity of COVID-19 in mice. They found that when this receptor is missing, the body has trouble producing interferons (IFNs), which are important for fighting the virus. The study showed that without Tlr7 and another related protein called Irf7, the mice developed more severe symptoms, had higher levels of the virus in their lungs, and took longer to produce antibodies against COVID-19. This suggests that the activation of these receptors is crucial for developing a strong defense against the virus.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7)deficiency-accelerated severe COVID-19 is associated with reduced production of interferons (IFNs). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To address these questions, we utilizeTlr7andIrf7deficiency mice, single-cell RNA analysis together with bone marrow transplantation approaches. We demonstrate that at the early phase of infection, SARS-CoV-2 causes the upregulation ofTlr7,Irf7, and IFN pathways in the lungs of the infected mice. The deficiency ofTlr7andIrf7globally and/or in immune cells in mice increases the severity of COVID-19 via impaired IFN activation in both immune and/or non-immune cells, leading to increased lung viral loads. These effects are associated with reduced IFN alpha and gamma levels in the circulation. The deficiency ofTlr7tends to cause the reduced production and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in the lungs of the infected mice, indicative of reduced IRF7 activation. Despite higher amounts of lung viral antigen,Tlr7orIrf7deficiency resulted in substantially reduced production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, thereby delaying the viral clearance. These results highlight the importance of the activation of TLR7 and IRF7 leading to IFN production on the development of innate and adaptive immunity against COVID-19.</p>

Scientists developed a new test that can detect if someone has antibodies against COVID-19 just by looking at a small blood or saliva sample on a paper disc. The test uses special molecules that bind to the antibodies and then helps create a tiny piece of DNA, which is measured using a machine. This makes it possible to quickly and easily check if people have been vaccinated or infected with COVID-19.

The study showed that this new test works well for detecting antibodies in blood samples, but less effectively in saliva samples. However, the results still suggest that it's a useful tool for monitoring the body's response to vaccination.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Using a modified proximity extension assay, total and immunoglobulin (Ig) class-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were sensitively and conveniently detected directly from √∏1.2¬†mm discs cut from dried blood and saliva spots (DBS and DSS) without the need for elution. For total Ig detection, antigen probes were prepared by conjugating recombinant spike protein subunit 1 (S1-RBD) to a pair of oligonucleotides. To detect isotype-specific antibody reactivity, one antigen probe was replaced with oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies specific for antibody isotypes. Binding of pairs of oligonucleotide-conjugated probes to antibodies in patient samples brings oligonucleotides in proximity. An added DNA polymerase uses a transient hybridization between the oligonucleotides to prime synthesis of a DNA strand, which serves as a DNA amplicon that is quantified by real-time PCR. The S1-RBD-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in DBS samples collected over the course of a first and second vaccination exhibited kinetics consistent with previous reports. Both DBS and DSS collected from 42 individuals in the autumn of 2023 showed significant level of total S1-RBD antibodies with a correlation of R‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.70. However, levels in DSS were generally 10 to 100-fold lower than in DBS. Anti-S1-RBD IgG and IgA in DSS demonstrated a correlation of R‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.6.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Long COVID is when you feel sick for a really long time after you get an illness like the flu or coronavirus. This can happen even weeks or months later. It's hard to understand because different people have different symptoms, and doctors use different words to describe them.

In this study, scientists used special computer tools to look at old medical records from a hospital in Brazil. They looked for patterns and similar terms that might represent the same condition. This helped them see what long COVID looks like across many patients. They also found tricky words (like those with extra parts or opposite meanings) that can be confusing.

By using these new computer tools, they hope to better understand this long-lasting sickness so doctors can help more people who are sick from it. These tools could work in other hospitals too!</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Long COVID is characterized by persistent that extends symptoms beyond established timeframes. Its varied presentation across different populations and healthcare systems poses significant challenges in understanding its clinical manifestations and implications. In this study, we present a novel application of text mining technique to automatically extract unstructured data from a long COVID survey conducted at a prominent university hospital in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Our phonetic text clustering (PTC) method enables the exploration of unstructured Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) data to unify different written forms of similar terms into a single phonemic representation. We used n-gram text analysis to detect compound words and negated terms in Portuguese-BR, focusing on medical conditions and symptoms related to long COVID. By leveraging text mining, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of this chronic condition and its implications for healthcare systems globally. The model developed in this study has the potential for scalability and applicability in other healthcare settings, thereby supporting broader research efforts and informing clinical decision-making for long COVID patients.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Background: Some people who got infected with COVID-19 also take medicine for high blood sugar. We wanted to know if taking a specific type of diabetes medication called SGLT2 inhibitors helps prevent heart and kidney problems.

Methods: We looked at medical records of over 100,000 veterans in the US who had COVID-19 and took diabetes medication between March 2020 and June 2023. Some took SGLT2 inhibitors while others took different types of diabetes medication.

Results: Our study found that people taking SGLT2 inhibitors were less likely to have serious heart problems (such as a heart attack or stroke) and kidney issues (such as needing dialysis). They also had fewer hospitalizations, anemia, and acute kidney injury. These benefits were seen after about 1.5 years of follow-up.

Conclusions: Taking SGLT2 inhibitors may help people with COVID-19 on diabetes medication avoid heart and kidney problems.</p><br>

                <p>BackgroundWhether use of SGLT2 inhibitors reduces the risk of cardiovascular and kidney events in people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear.MethodsWe used the healthcare databases of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 107,776 participants on antihyperglycemic therapy and had SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 01, 2020 and June 10, 2023. Within them, 11,588 used SGLT2 inhibitors and 96,188 used other antihyperglycemics. We examined the risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)‚Äîa composite of death, myocardial infarction and stroke, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE)‚Äîa composite of death, eGFR decline >¬†50%, and end stage kidney disease after balancing baseline characteristics between groups through inverse probability weighting. Survival analyses were conducted to generate hazard ratio (HR) and absolute risk reduction per 100 person-years (ARR).ResultsOver a median follow up of 1.57 (IQR: 1.05‚Äì2.49) years, compared to the control group, SGLT2 inhibitors use is associated with reduced risk of MACE (HR 0.82 (0.77, 0.88), ARR 1.73 (1.21, 2.25)) and reduced risk of MAKE (HR 0.75 (0.71, 0.80), ARR 2.62 (2.13, 3.11)). Compared to the control group, SGLT2 inhibitors use is associated with reduced risk of the secondary outcomes of hospitalization (HR 0.94 (0.90, 0.98), ARR 1.06 (1.36, 1.76)), anemia (HR 0.71 (0.65, 0.76), ARR 2.43 (1.95, 2.90)), and acute kidney injury (HR 0.84 (0.79, 0.89), ARR 1.86 (1.29, 2.42)).ConclusionsAmong people with SARS-CoV-2 infection on antihyperglycemic therapy, compared to those on other antihyperglycemics, those on SGLT2 inhibitors have less risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

COVID-19 can be very serious for some people, especially those with weakened immune systems. To protect against this and other respiratory infections, scientists are looking at ways to create sprays that can help block the virus from entering the body through the nose.

A new nasal spray called Astodrimer Sodium (AS) was tested along with four other types of sprays. The AS spray showed promise in blocking the virus and not harming the delicate cells in the nose. It also didn't interfere with the natural mucus-clearing function of the nose.

In contrast, some of the other sprays had limited ability to block the virus and even caused problems by slowing down or stopping the mucus-clearing process. The AS spray seems to be a safe and effective option for protecting against respiratory viruses in the nose.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 remains a severe condition for many including immunocompromised individuals. There remains a need for effective measures against this and other respiratory infections, which transmit via virus-laden droplets that reach the nasal or oral mucosae. Nasal sprays offer potential protection against viruses. Such formulations should preserve normal nasal mucociliary function. The antiviral barrier efficacy and effects on mucociliary function of astodrimer sodium nasal spray (AS-NS) were evaluated and compared with other available nasal sprays‚Äîlow pH hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC-NS), iota-carrageenan (Carr-NS), nitric oxide (NO-NS), and povidone iodine (PI-NS). Assays simulated clinical conditions. Antiviral barrier function and cell viability were assessed in airway cell monolayers, while a model of fully differentiated human nasal epithelium (MucilAir‚Ñ¢) was utilized to evaluate tissue integrity, cytotoxicity, cilia beating frequency, and mucociliary clearance. AS-NS reduced infectious virus in cell monolayers and demonstrated a benign cytotoxicity profile. In human nasal epithelium ex vivo, AS-NS had no impact on mucociliary function (cilia beating nor mucociliary clearance). Carr-NS, HPMC-NS, NO-NS and PI-NS demonstrated limited antiviral effects, while HPMC-NS caused inhibition of mucociliary function. Astodrimer sodium nasal spray demonstrates an acceptable nonclinical efficacy and safety profile as a barrier nasal spray against respiratory viral infection in the nasal cavity.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Scientists conducted a study called SETANTA to investigate how COVID-19 affects people's hearts. They looked at patients who had recently had COVID-19 and wanted to see if they still had symptoms or heart problems. The study found that many participants (83%) still had symptoms like fatigue, headaches, etc. 

The researchers also used tests to check the patients' hearts for damage and found that some of them had abnormal results. For example, about 2% of participants had inflammation in their hearts, while about 17% had a problem with their heart's ability to pump blood.

Another important finding was that many patients (32%) had high levels of a protein called von Willebrand factor antigen, which can indicate an increased risk of clotting. The study suggests that people who recently recovered from COVID-19 may be at higher risk for future health problems due to persistent symptoms and abnormal heart readings.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>SETANTA (Study of HEarT DiseAse and ImmuNiTy After COVID-19 in Ireland) study aimed to investigate symptom burden and incidence of cardiac abnormalities after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-19 and to correlate these results with biomarkers of immunological response and coagulation. SETANTA was a prospective, single-arm observational cross-sectional study condcuted in a primary practice setting, and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04823182). Patients with recent COVID-19 infection (‚â•‚Äâ6¬†weeks and ‚â§‚Äâ12¬†months) were prospectively enrolled. Primary outcomes of interest were markers of cardiac injury detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), which included left ventricular ejection fraction, late gadolinium enhancement and pericardial abnormalities, as well as relevant biomarkers testing immunological response and coagulopathy. 100 patients (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ129 approached) were included, amongst which 64% were female. Mean age of the total cohort was 45.2 years. The median (interquartile range) time interval between COVID-19 infection and enrolment was 189 [125, 246]¬†days. 83% of participants had at least one persistent symptom, while 96% had positive serology for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Late gadolinium enhancement, pericardial effusion, was present in 2.2% and 8.3% respectively, while left ventricular ejection fraction was below the normal reference limit in 17.4% of patients. Von Willebrand factor antigen was elevated in 32.7% of patients and Fibrinogen and D-Dimer levels were found to be elevated in 10.2% and 11.1% of patients, respectively. In a cohort of primary practice patients recently recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, prevalence of persistent symptoms and markers of abnormal coagulation were high, despite a lower frequency of abnormalities on CMR compared with prior reports of patients assessed in a hospital setting.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04823182 (prospectively registered on 30th March 2021).</p>

A study was done to see how well antibodies in the blood protect against COVID-19 after getting vaccinated. The research showed that people who have these antibodies are less likely to get sick with COVID-19. But since new variants of the virus have emerged, scientists wanted to know if these antibodies still work.

The study found that even though many people already had antibodies from previous vaccinations or infections, the level of protection they offered was still strong. In fact, having higher levels of antibodies meant a lower chance of getting COVID-19.

This research suggests that measuring antibody levels in the blood can still be a good way to see how well someone is protected against COVID-19, even after new variants have emerged.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>In the phase 3 Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial (NCT04470427), post-dose two Ancestral Spike-specific binding (bAb) and neutralizing (nAb) antibodies were shown to be correlates of risk (CoR) and of protection against Ancestral-lineage COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants. In the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron era, Omicron subvariants with varying degrees of immune escape now dominate, seropositivity rates are high, and booster doses are administered, raising questions on whether and how these developments affect the bAb and nAb correlates. To address these questions, we assess post-boost BA.1 Spike-specific bAbs and nAbs as CoRs and as correlates of booster efficacy in COVE. For naive individuals, bAbs and nAbs inversely correlate with Omicron COVID-19: hazard ratios (HR) per 10-fold marker increase (95% confidence interval) are 0.16 (0.03, 0.79) and 0.31 (0.10, 0.96), respectively. In non-naive individuals the analogous results are similar: 0.15 (0.04, 0.63) and 0.28 (0.07, 1.08). For naive individuals, three vs two-dose booster efficacy correlates with predicted nAb titer at exposure, with estimates -8% (-126%, 48%), 50% (25%, 67%), and 74% (49%, 87%), at 56, 251, and 891 Arbitrary Units/ml. These results support the continued use of antibody as a surrogate endpoint.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

The COVID-19 virus is still difficult to treat, especially when it becomes very severe. Scientists are trying to understand how the virus works so they can find new ways to fight it. One part of the virus, called the E protein, has been shown to be important for its growth and survival inside a host cell.

Researchers have discovered that this E protein can interact with other proteins in the cell that help regulate calcium levels. This interaction can affect how well these proteins work, which can lead to inflammation and make COVID-19 more severe.

The study found that the E protein can bind to these regulatory proteins and change their shape, making them less effective at doing their job. This could be a key part of why the virus causes such strong immune responses in people.

By understanding how this works, scientists may be able to find new ways to treat COVID-19 by targeting these interactions between the E protein and other cell proteins.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The clinical management of severe COVID-19 cases is not yet well resolved. Therefore, it is important to identify and characterize cell signaling pathways involved in virus pathogenesis that can be targeted therapeutically. Envelope (E) protein is a structural protein of the virus, which is known to be highly expressed in the infected host cell and is a key virulence factor; however, its role is poorly characterized. The E protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein that can assemble into a pentamer forming a viroporin, perturbing Ca2+homeostasis. Because it is structurally similar to regulins such as, for example, phospholamban, that regulate the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA), we investigated whether the SARS-CoV-2 E protein affects the SERCA system as an exoregulin. Using FRET experiments we demonstrate that E protein can form oligomers with regulins, and thus can alter the monomer/multimer regulin ratio and consequently influence their interactions with SERCAs. We also confirm that a direct interaction between E protein and SERCA2b results in a decrease in SERCA-mediated ER Ca2+reload. Structural modeling of the complexes indicates an overlapping interaction site for E protein and endogenous regulins. Our results reveal novel links in the host-virus interaction network that play an important role in viral pathogenesis and may provide a new therapeutic target for managing severe inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic showed that some people experience problems with their sense of smell and taste after getting infected. This study looked at how common this problem was, what might make it more likely, and how well people recovered.

About 47% of patients in this study had these problems, which were more common in women and less common in older adults who got a special treatment called monoclonal antibodies. When researchers tested some patients' sense of smell and taste, they found that about two-thirds could smell things only slightly or not at all, while one-fourth couldn't taste things normally.

This study showed that problems with smell and taste after COVID-19 can be quite complex and unpredictable. Understanding this better will help doctors develop treatments to prevent or fix these problems in the future.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 pandemic brought chemosensory impairment to the forefront of medicine, revealing gaps in the knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms, true prevalence and preventive/therapeutic alternatives. This is a sub-study of the ORCHESTRA cohort focusing on post-COVID-19 chemosensory symptoms. Risk factors for neurosensorial cluster of post-COVID-19 syndrome (NSc-PCS) were assessed through multivariable analysis. Psychophysical validated tests were applied on a sub-population of 50 patients. Qualitative chemosensory symptoms as well as nasal and oral chemesthesis were evaluated through anamnestic interview and the quality of life through the SF-36 questionnaire. Chemosensory symptoms evolution and olfactory training‚Äôs outcome were assessed through phone-call interviews. Out of 1187 patients (female, N‚Äâ=‚Äâ630), 550 (47%) presented NSc-PCS, with a lower risk for older age and monoclonal antibodies treatment, and a higher risk in females (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Out of the 50 patients evaluated with psychophysical tests, 66% showed smell reduction with a qualitative alteration in 50% of hyposmic and 35% of normosmic patients. Hypogeusia was present in 14 (28%) of the patients assessed, with 56% showing a qualitative alteration; 53% of normogeusic patients presented qualitative disorders. NSc-PCS has a complex, fluctuating, multifaceted presentation. Quantifying and characterizing COVID-19-related chemosensory impairment is key to understand underlying mechanisms and to develop preventive and therapeutic treatment.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract that a young person can understand:

Scientists have created new vaccine ingredients called antigens to help fight against COVID-19 viruses that keep changing over time. They designed three new antigens (called T2_32, T2_35, and T2_36) that work well together to protect people from different types of COVID-19 variants.

Tests on animals showed that these new antigens are very effective at creating a strong defense against the virus. When given as a vaccine, they even worked better than some existing vaccines.

These findings suggest that using computer-designed modifications to create more powerful vaccines could be an important tool in fighting against COVID-19 and its evolving variants.</p><br>

Here we describe three novel in-silico designed spike-based antigens capable of inducing neutralising antibodies across a spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Three sets of antigens utilising pre-Delta (T2_32), and post-Gamma sequence data (T2_35 and T2_36) were designed. T2_32 elicited superior neutralising responses against VOCs compared to the Wuhan-1 spike antigen in DNA prime-boost immunisation regime in guinea pigs. Heterologous boosting with the attenuated poxvirus - Modified vaccinia Ankara expressing T2_32 induced broader neutralising immune responses in all primed animals. T2_32, T2_35 and T2_36 elicited broader neutralising capacity compared to the Omicron BA.1 spike antigen administered by mRNA immunisation in mice. These findings demonstrate the utility of structure-informed computationally derived modifications of spike-based antigens for inducing broad immune responses covering more than 2 years of evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

                <p>Immunologic mediators profile in COVID-19 convalescence</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract that a young person can understand:

A new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic in 2020. To understand how our bodies fight this virus, scientists studied people who had recovered from COVID-19. They took blood samples from these individuals and measured different markers in their blood to see what happened as they got better.

The study found that most people developed antibodies (special proteins) against the virus after getting sick. Some of these antibodies lasted longer than others. The researchers also saw changes in the types of immune cells (like soldiers) in the blood over time.

What's interesting is that our immune system starts with a "fighting" response to the virus, but as we get better, it shifts towards a "repair" response. This study highlights the importance of understanding how our immune system works, especially after we've gotten sick with something like COVID-19. Knowing this can help us develop better treatments and vaccines in the future.

The bottom line is that our bodies are pretty amazing at fighting off viruses, but there's still a lot to learn about how they work!</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2 caused the pandemic situation experienced since the beginning of 2020, and many countries faced the rapid spread and severe form of the disease. Mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the host were observed during acute phase, but few data are available when related to immunity dynamics in convalescents. We conducted a longitudinal study, with 51 healthy donors and 62 COVID-19 convalescent patients, which these had a 2-month follow-up after symptoms recovery. Venous blood sample was obtained from all participants to measure blood count, subpopulations of monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. Serum was used to measure cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, anti-N IgG and anti-S IgG/IgM antibodies. Statistic was performed by Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test, and linear regression with days post symptoms and antibody titers. All analysis had confidence interval of 95%. Less than 35% of convalescents were anti-S IgM+, while more than 80% were IgG+ in D30. Anti-N IgG decreased along time, with loss of seroreactivity of 13%. Eosinophil count played a distinct role on both antibodies during all study, and the convalescence was orchestrated by higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and IL-15, but initial stages were marked by increase in myeloid DCs, B1 lymphocytes, inflammatory and patrolling monocytes, G-CSF and IL-2. Later convalescence seemed to change to cytotoxicity mediated by T lymphocytes, plasmacytoid DCs, VEGF, IL-9 and CXCL10. Anti-S IgG antibodies showed the longest perseverance and may be a better option for diagnosis. The inflammatory pattern is yet present on initial stage of convalescence, but quickly shifts to a reparative dynamic. Meanwhile eosinophils seem to play a role on anti-N levels in convalescence, although may not be the major causative agent. We must highlight the importance of immunological markers on acute clinical outcomes, but their comprehension to potentialize adaptive system must be explored to improve immunizations and further preventive policies.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Detecting COVID-19 quickly and accurately is crucial to stopping its spread. We developed a fast test that can detect the virus in just 3 hours, using a special technique called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). This test works by using tiny probes to find and highlight the presence of the virus's genetic material (RNA) in cells.

We tested this method on cell cultures and found it to be accurate and efficient. We also used it to detect COVID-19 in samples from patients, including those taken from the mouth and throat. The results were excellent, with the test being able to identify the presence of the virus quickly and accurately.

This new method could significantly improve the accuracy and speed of COVID-19 detection, making it easier to control outbreaks and keep people safe.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Early, rapid, and accurate diagnostic tests play critical roles not only in the identification/management of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, but also in fast and effective public health surveillance, containment, and response. Our aim has been to develop a fast and robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNAs by using an HEK 293¬†T cell culture model. At various times after being transfected with SARS-CoV-2 E and N plasmids, HEK 293¬†T cells were fixed and then hybridized with ATTO-labeled short DNA probes (about 20 nt). At 4¬†h, 12¬†h, and 24¬†h after transfection, SARS-CoV-2 E and N mRNAs were clearly revealed as solid granular staining inside HEK 293¬†T cells at all time points. Hybridization time was also reduced to 1¬†h for faster detection, and the test was completed within 3¬†h with excellent results. In addition, we have successfully detected 3 mRNAs (E mRNA, N mRNA, and ORF1a (‚àí) RNA) simultaneously inside the buccal cells of COVID-19 patients. Our high-resolution RNA FISH might significantly increase the accuracy and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection, while significantly reducing test time. The method can be conducted on smears containing cells (e.g., from nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, or buccal swabs) or smears without cells (e.g., from sputum, saliva, or drinking water/wastewater) for detecting various types of RNA viruses and even DNA viruses at different timepoints of infection.</p>

                <p>Robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in the island population of Greenland</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

In Greenland, the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively mild compared to other countries. One reason for this might be that many people in Greenland got vaccinated against COVID-19.

To understand how well the vaccines worked, researchers looked at the immune system response of 430 adults who had received two doses of the vaccine. They measured the levels of antibodies (which help fight off viruses) in these people's blood and saliva over a period of up to 11 months after their second dose.

The results showed that almost all participants (96% after two months, and 98% after 11 months) had enough antibodies to protect them from COVID-19. People who had previously been infected with COVID-19 even had higher levels of antibodies. In people over 60 years old, the vaccine response was slightly weaker.

The researchers also found that all participants had a strong T-cell response (another part of the immune system) against COVID-19. These results suggest that the vaccines were very effective in protecting Greenlanders against COVID-19, and contributed to the mild impact of the pandemic in the country.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>BackgroundIn Greenland, the COVID-19 pandemic was characterised by a late onset of community transmission and a low impact on the healthcare system, hypothesised as being partly due to a high uptake of vaccinations. To underpin this description, we aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 immune response post-vaccination in a Greenlandic population.MethodsIn this observational cohort study, we included 430 adults in Greenland who had received a complete two-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at enrolment. The total plasma SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein Ig antibodies (S-Ab) induced by either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine, was measured up to 11 months after the second vaccine dose. In addition, total salivary S-Abs were examined in 107 participants, and the T-cell response to the spike glycoprotein was assessed in 78 participants out of the entire study cohort.ResultsHere we demonstrate that two months after the second vaccine dose, 96% of participants have protective plasma S-Ab levels. By 11 months, 98% have protective levels, with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection particularly enhancing S-Ab levels by 37% (95% CI 25‚Äì51%). Among individuals aged 60 years and older, we observe a 21% (95% CI 7‚Äì33%) reduction in antibody response. Total salivary S-Ab levels are detectable in all participants and significantly correlate with plasma levels. Moreover, all participants exhibit a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response 11 months post-primary vaccination.ConclusionsOur findings show that Greenlanders exhibit a robust and lasting immune response, both humoral and cellular, comparable to other population groups up to at least 11 months after the second vaccine dose. These results corroborate the hypothesis that vaccines contributed to the mild impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Greenlandic population.</p>

                <p>A Gaussia luciferase reporter assay for the evaluation of coronavirus Nsp5/3CLpro activity</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Human coronaviruses cause sickness in many people each year. Some types like MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 can be very serious.

To help stop these viruses from spreading, scientists are looking for new medicines that can fight them. A drug called Paxlovid has already been used successfully to treat some of these illnesses by stopping a protein inside the virus called 3CLpro.

But sometimes, if we use the same drug too much or for too long, the virus might start to get stronger and not work as well anymore. So researchers want to find more ways to fight these viruses.

They created an easy-to-use test that can quickly tell them how strong a virus is and if medicines are working against it. This test uses parts of another protein found in our bodies (ACE2-Gal4) along with the 3CLpro from coronaviruses. When 3CLpro cuts this protein, it causes a light-producing chemical to be made.

This new test can work on any coronavirus and can measure both how well medicine is stopping the virus and if the virus has become more powerful in some way. They tested the medicine Paxlovid using their test and found that it works against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

The test also helped them understand better how mutations (changes) in the 3CLpro protein can make it stronger or weaker, which is important for future research.

Overall, this new test makes it easier to study coronavirus proteins and find new medicines.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) infect millions of people every year. Among these, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 caused significant morbidity and mortality and their emergence highlights the risk of possible future coronavirus outbreaks. Therefore, broadly-active anti-coronavirus drugs are needed. Pharmacological inhibition of the hCoV protease Nsp5 (3CLpro) is clinically beneficial as shown by the wide and effective use of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir, ritonavir). However, further treatment options are required due to the risk of drug resistance. To facilitate the assessment of coronavirus protease function and its pharmacological inhibition, we developed an assay allowing rapid and reliable quantification of Nsp5 activity under biosafety level 1 conditions. It is based on an ACE2-Gal4 transcription factor fusion protein separated by a Nsp5 recognition site. Cleavage by Nsp5 releases the Gal4 transcription factor, which then induces the expression of Gaussia luciferase. Our assay is compatible with Nsp5 proteases from all hCoVs and allows simultaneous measurement of inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of the tested compounds. Proof-of-concept measurements confirmed that nirmatrelvir, GC376 and lopinavir inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 function. Furthermore, the assay accurately predicted the impact of Nsp5 mutations on catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity. Overall, the reporter assay is suitable for evaluating viral protease activity.</p>

This study looked at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected eye diseases and changed people's risk factors in South Korea between 2015 and 2021. The researchers analyzed data from over 50,000 people and found that being infected with COVID-19 increased the risk of developing cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (a type of vision loss). They also found that other health conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression were linked to eye diseases too. However, having COVID-19 did not increase the risk of getting glaucoma (another type of eye disease). The study suggests that cataracts and age-related macular degeneration might be more affected by people's lifestyle and environment rather than just their genetic predisposition.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on ocular diseases and changes in risk factors before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was conducted using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015‚Äì2021, a national cross-sectional health examination and survey. Associations between ocular diseases and risk factors were determined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. Bivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate of the impact of COVID-19 on ocular diseases. Individuals were divided into two age groups (<‚Äâ60 and‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ60¬†years). A total of 50,158 people were diagnosed, of whom 7270 were diagnosed with cataract, 921 with glaucoma, and 439 with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Risk factors for cataract were COVID-19 pandemic (OR 1.161), hypertension (OR 1.608), diabetes (OR 1.573), dyslipidemia (OR 1.167), stroke (OR 1.272), and depression (OR 1.567). Risk factors for AMD were COVID-19 pandemic (OR 1.600), dyslipidemia (OR 1.610), and depression (OR 1.466). Risk factors for glaucoma were hypertension (OR 1.234), dyslipidemia (OR 1.529), diabetes (OR 1.323), and depression (OR 1.830). The COVID-19 pandemic was a risk factor for cataracts and AMD, but not for glaucoma. Cataracts and AMD may be more influenced by the acquired health conditions or the environment.</p>

                <p>Influence of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine dosing interval on the risk of myocarditis</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

A serious heart condition called myocarditis is more likely to happen after getting certain COVID-19 vaccines. The risk is highest after the second dose and lower with later booster doses. We studied over 7,000 cases of myocarditis in people aged 12 and up to see if there's a connection between how often you get vaccinated and the risk of this condition. Our results show that taking longer breaks between vaccine doses can decrease the risk by up to four times, especially for people under 50. This suggests that waiting at least six months before getting another booster shot might be a good idea.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Myocarditis is the most salient serious adverse event following messenger RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. The highest risk is observed after the second dose compared to the first, whereas the level of risk associated with more distant booster doses seems to lie in between. We aimed to assess the relation between dosing interval and the risk of myocarditis, for both the two-dose primary series and the third dose (first booster). This matched case-control study included 7911 cases of myocarditis aged 12 or more in a period where approximately 130 million vaccine doses were administered. Here we show that longer intervals between each consecutive dose, including booster, may decrease the occurrence of vaccine-associated myocarditis by up to a factor of 4, especially under age 50. These results suggest that a minimum 6-month interval might be required when scheduling additional booster vaccination.</p>

                <p>Structural basis for the evolution and antibody evasion of SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.86 and JN.1 subvariants</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic is still a problem and some new versions of the virus (called BA.2.86 and JN.1) are spreading fast around the world. These viruses have many mutations that make it harder for our immune systems to fight them off. Scientists studied these new viruses and found out how they evade our antibodies, which are like superheroes that protect us from germs.

They also looked at the structure of the virus and how it interacts with human cells. They discovered some important changes in the way these new viruses attach to human cells, making it harder for them to be stopped by our immune systems.

This research helps us understand why these new viruses are spreading quickly and what we can do to stop them. It's like having a map of where the virus is evolving and how it's adapting to avoid being caught by our bodies' defenses.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The Omicron subvariants of SARS-CoV-2, especially for BA.2.86 and JN.1, have rapidly spread across multiple countries, posing a significant threat in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Distinguished by 34 additional mutations on the Spike (S) protein compared to its BA.2 predecessor, the implications of BA.2.86 and its evolved descendant, JN.1 with additional L455S mutation in receptor-binding domains (RBDs), are of paramount concern. In this work, we systematically examine the neutralization susceptibilities of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and reveal the enhanced antibody evasion of BA.2.86 and JN.1. We also determine the cryo-EM structures of the trimeric S proteins from BA.2.86 and JN.1 in complex with the host receptor ACE2, respectively. The mutations within the RBDs of BA.2.86 and JN.1 induce a remodeling of the interaction network between the RBD and ACE2. The L455S mutation of JN.1 further induces a notable shift of the RBD‚ÄìACE2 interface, suggesting the notably reduced binding affinity of JN.1 than BA.2.86. An analysis of the broadly neutralizing antibodies possessing core neutralizing epitopes reveals the antibody evasion mechanism underlying the evolution of Omicron BA.2.86 subvariant. In general, we construct a landscape of evolution in virus-receptor of the circulating Omicron subvariants.</p>

                <p>Broad protection and respiratory immunity of dual mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 variants</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Scientists have been working on vaccines to protect us from COVID-19. However, the virus has changed over time, making some vaccines less effective. Researchers developed a new type of vaccine that targets a specific part of the virus and tested it alone or combined with another vaccine in hamsters. The results showed that the new vaccine, when used alone or together with the other vaccine, was very good at protecting against certain types of COVID-19. Additionally, studies in mice found that this combination vaccine triggered an immune response specifically in the lungs, which is where COVID-19 typically infects us. These findings suggest that this new vaccine could be effective against various strains of COVID-19 and help prevent future outbreaks.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>While first-generation, spike (S)-based COVID-19 vaccines were effective against early SARS-CoV-2 strains, the rapid evolution of novel Omicron subvariants have substantially reduced vaccine efficacy. As such, broadly protective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are needed to prevent future viral emergence. In addition, it remains less clear whether peripheral immunization, especially with mRNA vaccines, elicits effective respiratory immunity. Our group has developed a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and has tested its use in combination with the S-based mRNA vaccine (mRNA-S). In this study, we examined efficacy of mRNA-N alone or in combination with mRNA-S (mRNA-S+N) against more immune evasive Omicron variants in hamsters. Our data show that mRNA-N alone induces a modest but significant protection against BA.5 and that dual mRNA-S+N vaccination confers complete protection against both BA.5 and BQ.1, preventing detection of virus in the hamster lungs. Analysis of respiratory immune response in mice shows that intramuscular mRNA-S+N immunization effectively induces respiratory S- and N-specific T cell responses in the lungs and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as well as antigen-specific binding IgG in BAL. Together, our data further support mRNA-S+N as a potential pan-COVID-19 vaccine for broad protection against current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

                <p>Mucosal adenovirus vaccine boosting elicits IgA and durably prevents XBB.1.16 infection in nonhuman primates</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>This study looked at different ways to give a vaccine for a virus that causes the flu in animals (SARS-CoV-2). They compared two methods: putting the vaccine directly into someone's arm, or giving it through their nose or mouth.

The team found that when they gave the vaccine through the nose and mouth, it worked better. The vaccine helped protect against the virus not just in the throat but also deep inside the lungs. This method also made the immune system create antibodies (special proteins) that can help stop the virus from spreading.

In contrast, giving the vaccine by putting it into someone's arm only protected the lower parts of their airways.

The study suggests that giving a vaccine through the nose or mouth might be better because:
1. It stops the virus in both the throat and lungs.
2. It makes antibodies that can stop other people from catching the virus too.
3. It makes certain immune cells that help fight off the virus.

So, this research shows how giving a vaccine through the nose or mouth could better protect against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent it from spreading to others.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>A mucosal route of vaccination could prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication at the site of infection and limit transmission. We compared protection against heterologous XBB.1.16 challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs) ~5 months following intramuscular boosting with bivalent mRNA encoding WA1 and BA.5 spike proteins or mucosal boosting with a WA1‚ÄìBA.5 bivalent chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored vaccine delivered by intranasal or aerosol device. NHPs boosted by either mucosal route had minimal virus replication in the nose and lungs, respectively. By contrast, protection by intramuscular mRNA was limited to the lower airways. The mucosally delivered vaccine elicited durable airway IgG and IgA responses and, unlike the intramuscular mRNA vaccine, induced spike-specific B cells in the lungs. IgG, IgA and T cell responses correlated with protection in the lungs, whereas mucosal IgA alone correlated with upper airway protection. This study highlights differential mucosal and serum correlates of protection and how mucosal vaccines can durably prevent infection against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Scientists studied 114 people who had COVID-19 and found that some developed a secondary infection called pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). This study looked for factors that might increase the risk of developing CAPA.

The results showed that certain conditions, such as being on kidney transplant medication, having high levels of inflammation in the body, or needing to be on a ventilator for a long time, made it more likely for someone with COVID-19 to develop CAPA.

The researchers found that three main factors were strongly linked to an increased risk of CAPA: high levels of inflammation in the body, low levels of immune cells called T-cells, and needing to be on a ventilator for a long time. Identifying these risk factors can help doctors start treatment earlier, which may improve outcomes for people with CAPA.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) had been reported, and raised concern about this secondary infection due to the high mortality. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for CAPA. The enrolled 114 COVID-19 patients were further divided into CAPA group and non-CAPA group. Demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory parameters and therapeutic schedule between the two groups were compared to identify the independent risk factors for CAPA by univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Sensitivity and specificity of independent risk factors were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Univariate analysis showed that renal transplant, IL-6 and CRP levels, decreased CD4‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cell and CD8‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cell, duration of antibiotics therapy, and prolonged mechanical ventilation were risk factors for development of CAPA. These factors were further analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analysis and the results indicated that elevated IL-6 level, decreased CD4‚Äâ+‚ÄâT cell and prolonged mechanical ventilation could be recognized as independent risk factors for CAPA in COVID-19 patients. Identification of these risk factors is essential to initiate antifungal therapy as soon as possible to improve outcome of patients with CAPA.</p>

                <p>Acute-phase proteins as indicators of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The study looked at how certain chemicals called acute-phase proteins (APPs) affect how sick people get from COVID-19. They measured these chemicals in 96 people with COVID-19, along with some healthy people for comparison.

They found that:
- The levels of APPs change depending on how sick someone is from the disease and if they're getting enough oxygen.
- In very severe cases, where there's a lot of inflammation (called a cytokine storm), these chemicals can go up or down a lot.
- There are some APPs that don't usually get tested. The researchers found that two of them - procalcitonin and transferrin - help doctors tell if someone is going to survive their COVID-19.

They also noticed that measuring how sick people were using something called the MEWS scale didn't always match with another system used by doctors (National Institutes of Health). 

The researchers concluded that:
- Not all APPs change based on how bad a person's disease gets.
- Only two out of many tested APPs can help predict if someone will survive their COVID-19.
- Among the new ones they looked at, transferrin is the only one that seems to really matter in predicting who will get better or worse from COVID-19.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The aim of the study was to conduct of relationship of acute-phase proteins (APPs) with the severity of COVID-19 defined by National Institutes of Health and according to the criteria of MEWS scale, with the presence of a cytokine storm, oxygen therapy and patient survival. We enrolled 96 patients with COVID-19 and 30 healthy people. The samples were taken on the day of admission and after 9¬†days on average. Not only commonly used APPs such as CRP, procalcitonin and ferritin and also rarely assayed proteins such as transferrin, haptoglobin, Œ±1-acid glycoprotein and Œ±1-antitrypsin, were tested in the study. The levels of APPs depends on the severity of COVID-19 disease, on the presence of cytokine storm and used oxygen therapy. The greatest APPs changes occurred in the most advanced form of the disease, with the presence of a cytokine storm and the most intense oxygen therapy. The results obtained from MEWS scale were not consistent with National Institutes of Health scores. Studies in the second samples showed the quenching of the acute phase reactions and the effectiveness of oxygen therapy. Only two of the examined APPs i.e. procalcitonin and transferrin, differed between surviving and non-surviving patients, and these two predispose to the role of prognostic factors in Covid-19. In conclusion, the concentration of not all acute-phase proteins depends on the severity of COVID-19 disease, presence of cytokine storm, the used of oxygen therapy and only some of them (procalcitonin and transferrin) are related to the survival outcomes. Of the newly tested acute-phase proteins, only transferrin shows significance as a marker of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.</p>

                <p>Resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in camelid nasal organoids is associated with lack of ACE2 expression</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect different animals. How well an animal gets infected by SARS-CoV-2 depends on a special protein called ACE2 that the virus uses to enter cells.

While SARS-CoV-2 can use many versions of the ACE2 protein found in various camel species, it doesn't make these camels sick when they are exposed to the virus. In this study, researchers used tiny living copies of parts of animals' noses (called organoids) to see if camels could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 or another related virus called MERS-CoV.

The scientists found that while human nose copies can get infected with both viruses, camel nose copies don't. They also noticed something else: The camel nose copies had a different protein called DPP4 instead of ACE2. This led to the conclusion that because camels don't have enough of the ACE2 protein in their noses and upper respiratory tracts, they are resistant to SARS-CoV-2.

So basically, it's like the virus can use other proteins found in camels' noses, but these aren't as good at letting the virus inside cells. Because of this, camels don't get sick from the virus even if they're exposed to it.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects a variety of animal species. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is primarily determined by the utilization of the viral receptor, ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 can utilize a broad range of animal ACE2 isoforms in vitro, including the ACE2 from various camelid species. However, experimental infection of these animals does not lead to productive infection or seroconversion. In this study, we investigate the susceptibility of camelids to SARS-CoV-2 using novel well-differentiated camelid nasal organoids. We show that camelid nasal organoids are highly susceptible to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, but not to infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants (614G, BA.1 or EG.5.1.1). All viruses efficiently infected human airway organoids. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the absence of ACE2 on camelid nasal organoids and dromedary camel upper respiratory tract. In contrast, DPP4 was expressed in both camelid nasal organoids and the camel upper respiratory tract, which correlates with MERS-CoV infection. This study indicates that the camelid upper respiratory tract lacks expression of ACE2, which is associated with resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

                <p>T-cell responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variant among unvaccinated pregnant and postpartum women living with and without HIV in South Africa</p><br>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Scientists studied how people who are pregnant or have recently given birth and living with HIV react to COVID-19 in their bodies. They looked at 24 women without HIV and 15 women with HIV from low-income countries. The researchers found that these women's immune systems can fight off COVID-19 just as well as women who don't have HIV, even if they've never been vaccinated against the virus. They also discovered that the immune system's response to a specific part of the virus called Omicron is similar to its response to earlier versions of the virus. This means that people with COVID-19 can still get protection from their immune system, even if they haven't received a vaccine.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2 cell-mediated immunity remains understudied during pregnancy in unvaccinated Black African women living with HIV (WLWH) from low- and middle-income countries. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses 1 month following infection in 24 HIV-uninfected women and 15 WLWH at any stage during pregnancy or postpartum. The full-length spike (FLS) glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (N) protein of wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2, as well as mutated spike protein regions found in the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) were targeted by flow cytometry. WT-specific CD4+and CD8+T cells elicited similar FLS- and N-specific responses in HIV-uninfected women and WLWH. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-lymphocytes were predominantly TNF-Œ± monofunctional in pregnant and postpartum women living with and without HIV, with fever cells producing either IFN-Œ≥ or IL-2. Furthermore, T-cell responses were unaffected by Omicron-specific spike mutations as similar responses between Omicron and the ancestral virus were detected for CD4+and CD8+T cells. Our results collectively demonstrate comparable T-cell responses between WLWH on antiretroviral therapy and HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women who were na√Øve to Covid-19 vaccination. Additionally, we show that T cells from women infected with the ancestral virus, Beta variant (B.1.351), or Delta variant (B.1.617.2) can cross-recognize Omicron, suggesting an overall preservation of T-cell immunity.</p>

                <p>Antibodies utilizing VL6-57 light chains target a convergent cryptic epitope on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and potentially drive the genesis of Omicron variants</p><br>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Scientists have found that as COVID-19 spreads, it mutates and changes into different versions. This means that the antibodies created by our immune system when we get infected or vaccinated may not be able to recognize the virus if it changes too much. Researchers wanted to understand why this happens.

They discovered a group of antibodies that can fight COVID-19, and found out how they work together with other parts of the immune system to target the virus. They also found out that these antibodies are already present in people who have never had COVID-19, but are more abundant in people who have recovered from the disease.

However, when scientists tested these antibodies against a new variant of the virus called Omicron, they found out that it can evade their attack by making small changes to its structure. This suggests that the pressure from our immune system may be driving the evolution of the virus into more aggressive forms.

These findings provide further evidence that the spread of COVID-19 and its variants is influenced by our immune response, and highlight the importance of continued research into understanding how our bodies fight the virus.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 generates variants to challenge antibody immunity established by infection and vaccination. A connection between population immunity and genesis of virus variants has long been suggested but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing public antibodies defined by their shared usage of VL6-57 light chains. Although heavy chains of diverse genotypes are utilized, convergent HCDR3 rearrangements have been observed among these public antibodies to cooperate with germline VL6-57 LCDRs to target a convergent epitope defined by RBD residues S371-S373-S375. Antibody repertoire analysis identifies that this class of VL6-57 antibodies is present in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals and is clonally expanded in most COVID-19 patients. We confirm that Omicron-specific substitutions at S371, S373 and S375 mediate escape of antibodies of the VL6-57 class. These findings support that this class of public antibodies constitutes a potential immune pressure promoting the introduction of S371L/F-S373P-S375F in Omicron variants. The results provide further molecular evidence to support that antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by antibody mediated population immunity.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Many kids got sick with COVID-19 during an outbreak in Australia, but not much was known about how it affected them later on. We asked parents to fill out an online survey 12 weeks after their child had recovered from COVID-19 and found that only a small number (about 1 in 10) were still experiencing symptoms or problems with daily activities.

Out of those who reported ongoing issues, some kids had recovered by the time they saw a doctor, while others had existing conditions that got worse. A smaller group had something called Post-COVID Condition, which is similar to Long COVID.

Our study found that most kids who got COVID-19 recovered quickly, but for those who didn't, it can be a significant burden. We also discovered some risk factors that make kids more likely to experience ongoing problems after COVID-19, such as being older than 11 and having pre-existing medical conditions.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>BackgroundPediatric long COVID remains incompletely understood with scant Australian data available. We aimed to assess the impacts of the 2021 Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on symptoms and functioning 12 weeks post-acute infection in a cohort of children and adolescents.MethodsThe parents/carers of 11,864 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were invited, via email or text message, to complete an online survey assessing symptoms and functional impairment.Findings1731 (17.6%) responded to the survey. 203 (11.7%) reported continued symptoms and/or functional impairment which were flagged for clinical review, all others reported recovery. Of the 169 subsequently clinically reviewed, 63 had already recovered (37.3%) and 17 had exacerbation of pre-existing condition(s) (10.1%); 63 (37.3%) were diagnosed with a Post COVID Condition (PCC). Of these, 21 (12.4%) were considered to have features compatible with the United Kingdom consensus cases definition for Long COVID.InterpretationDuring an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 an online questionnaire with subsequent clinical review revealed self-reported non-recovery at 12 weeks in a minority of cases, with a spectrum of features. Long COVID comprised only a subset of cases with self-reported non-recovery, and is infrequent in children and adolescents, but still comprises a likely significant burden that warrants attention.ImpactOur study provides the only comprehensive estimate of the frequency and spectrum of post-COVID conditions in children from Australia. The high frequency of self-reported recovery, and low frequency of Long COVID compatible illness adds to the literature from other settings. Risk factors for post-COVID conditions in children are identified and include: age >11 year, and previous medical co-morbidity.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic required scientists to quickly identify new variants of the virus. This meant setting up a nationwide system to collect, analyze, and report data on patient samples in a very short time frame. We developed an infrastructure that allowed us to sequence over 594,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients in the US between March 2020 and July 2023. Our protocol (called "Virseq") ensures accurate and reliable sequencing of the entire virus genome, even for multiple strains co-infecting a patient.

                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought forth an urgent need for widespread genomic surveillance for rapid detection and monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. It necessitated design, development, and deployment of a nationwide infrastructure designed for sequestration, consolidation, and characterization of patient samples that disseminates de-identified information to public authorities in tight turnaround times. Here, we describe our development of such an infrastructure, which sequenced 594,832 high coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from isolates we collected in the United States (U.S.) from March 13th 2020 to July 3rd 2023. Our sequencing protocol (‚ÄòVirseq‚Äô) utilizes wet and dry lab procedures to generate mutation-resistant sequencing of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, capturing all major lineages. We also characterize 379 clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 multi-strain co-infections and ensure robust detection of emerging lineages via simulation. The modular infrastructure, sequencing, and analysis capabilities we describe support the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national surveillance program and serve as a model for rapid response to emerging pandemics at a national scale.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Researchers studied 5368 people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in Pakistan over two years. They looked at how the virus affected different age groups and the outcomes for patients.

They found that:

* Older adults (aged 60+) made up a larger proportion of patients during certain waves of the pandemic.
* Men were more likely to be infected earlier in the pandemic, but this changed later on.
* The mortality rate (death rate) varied across different waves, with some being higher than others.
* Certain conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury, increased the risk of death.
* Some patients who received a type of blood thinner called enoxaparin had lower odds of dying from COVID-19.

The study suggests that older adults and those with certain health complications are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 during certain waves of the pandemic.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>This retrospective cohort study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes and assess risk factors for mortality across the epidemic waves in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a major tertiary-care center in Pakistan. A total of 5368 patients with COVID-19, hospitalized between March 2020 and April 2022 were included. The median age was 58¬†years (IQR: 44‚Äì69), 41% were females, and the overall mortality was 12%. Comparative analysis of COVID-19 waves showed that the proportion of patients aged‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ60¬†years was highest during the post-wave 4 period (61.4%) and Wave 4 (Delta) (50%) (p<‚Äâ0.001). Male predominance decreased from 65.2% in Wave 2 to 44.2% in Wave 5 (Omicron) (p<‚Äâ0.001). Mortality rate was lowest at 9.4% in wave 5 and highest at 21.6% in the post-wave 4 period (p=‚Äâ0.041). In multivariable analysis for risk factors of mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was most strongly associated with mortality (aOR 22.98, 95% CI 15.28‚Äì34.55,p<‚Äâ0.001), followed by need for mechanical ventilation (aOR 6.81, 95% CI 5.13‚Äì9.05,p<‚Äâ0.001). Other significant risk factors included acute kidney injury (aOR 3.05, 95% CI 2.38‚Äì3.91,p<‚Äâ0.001), stroke (aOR 2.40, 95% CI 1.26‚Äì4.60, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008), pulmonary embolism (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.28‚Äì3.35,p=‚Äâ0.003), and age‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ60¬†years (aOR 2.45, 95% CI 1.95‚Äì3.09,p<‚Äâ0.001). Enoxaparin use was associated with lower mortality odds (aOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35‚Äì0.60,p<‚Äâ0.001. Patients hospitalized during Wave 4 (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.39‚Äì3.56,p<‚Äâ0.001) and the post-wave 4 period (aOR 2.82, 95% CI 1.37‚Äì5.80,p=‚Äâ0.005) had higher mortality odds compared to other waves. The study identifies higher mortality risk in patients admitted in Delta wave and post-wave, aged ‚â•‚Äâ60¬†years, and with respiratory and renal complications, and lower risk with anticoagulation during COVID-19 waves.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Most COVID-19 vaccines currently work by teaching our bodies to fight the virus's "Spike" protein. However, new variants of the virus can make this Spike protein change shape and become harder for our immune systems to recognize. To address this issue, researchers are working on developing vaccines that target a broader range of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

To do this, scientists used a powerful tool called mass spectrometry to identify tiny pieces of these proteins (called "immunopeptides") that can trigger an immune response. They tested these immunopeptides against different versions of human cells and found 248 unique peptides that were bound to specific parts of the cell's surface.

These findings could help create more effective COVID-19 vaccines by targeting multiple proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, rather than just one protein like the Spike protein.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Most COVID-19 vaccines elicit immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. However, Spike protein mutations in emerging strains and immune evasion by the SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrates the need to develop more broadly targeting vaccines. To facilitate this, we use mass spectrometry to identify immunopeptides derived from seven relatively conserved structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins (N, E, Nsp1/4/5/8/9). We use two different B-lymphoblastoid cell lines to map Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I and class II immunopeptidomes covering some of the prevalent HLA types across the global human population. We employ DNA plasmid transfection and direct antigen delivery approaches to sample different antigens and find 248 unique HLA class I and HLA class II bound peptides with 71 derived from N, 12 from E, 28 from Nsp1, 19 from Nsp4, 73 from Nsp8 and 45 peptides derived from Nsp9. Over half of the viral peptides are unpublished. T cell reactivity tested against 56 of the detected peptides shows CD8+and CD4+T cell responses against several peptides from the N, E, and Nsp9 proteins. Results from this study will aid the development of next-generation COVID vaccines targeting epitopes from across a number of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.</p>

                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract that a young person can understand:

Scientists conducted an experiment to test the effectiveness of a vaccine (mRNA-1273) in preventing COVID-19. The results showed that the vaccine was safe and worked well at preventing the disease in adults over 18 years old.

To see if another dose of the vaccine (called a booster) would help even more, researchers gave some people an extra dose after they had already received their first shots. They found that this booster shot helped prevent COVID-19, especially during times when new and more contagious variants of the virus were spreading.

The study also showed that the longer people waited between getting their first vaccine doses and receiving the booster, the better protected they were from getting COVID-19 again. Furthermore, the researchers found that people who received the booster had a stronger immune response against the virus than those who only got the initial shots.

Overall, this study suggests that vaccination with mRNA-1273, including a booster dose, is a safe and effective way to protect against COVID-19, even when new variants are present.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Primary vaccination with mRNA-1273 (100-¬µg) was safe and efficacious at preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the previously reported, blinded Part A of the phase 3 Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE; NCT04470427) trial in adults (‚â•18 years) across 99 U.S. sites. The open-label (Parts B and C) primary objectives were evaluation of long-term safety and effectiveness of primary vaccination plus a 50-¬µg booster dose; immunogenicity was a secondary objective. Of 29,035 open-label participants, 19,609 received boosters (mRNA-1273 [n=‚Äâ9647]; placebo-mRNA-1273 [n=‚Äâ9952]; placebo [n=‚Äâ10] groups). Booster safety was consistent with that reported for primary vaccination. Incidences of COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 were higher during the Omicron BA.1 than Delta variant waves and boosting versus non-boosting was associated with a significant, 47.0% (95% CI : 39.0-53.9%) reduction of Omicron BA.1 incidence (24.6 [23.4‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ25.8] vs 46.4 [40.6‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ52.7]/1000 person-months). In an exploratory Cox regression model adjusted for time-varying covariates, a longer median interval between primary vaccination and boosting (mRNA-1273 [13 months] vs placebo-mRNA-1273 [8 months]) was associated with significantly lower, COVID-19 risk (24.0% [16.0%‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ32.0%]) during Omicron BA.1 predominance. Boosting elicited greater immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 than primary vaccination, irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary vaccination and boosting with mRNA-1273 demonstrated acceptable safety, effectiveness and immunogenicity against COVID-19, including emergent variants.</p>

This suggests that how the body responds to COVID-19 early on may play a role in whether someone develops long-term symptoms.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>To understand the roles of acute-phase viral dynamics and host immune responses in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), we enrolled 136 participants within 5 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test. Participants self-collected up to 21 nasal specimens within the first 28 days post-symptom onset; interviewer-administered questionnaires and blood samples were collected at enrollment, days 9, 14, 21, 28, and month 4 and 8 post-symptom onset. Defining PASC as the presence of any COVID-associated symptom at their 4-month visit, we compared viral markers (quantity and duration of nasal¬†viral RNA load, infectious viral load, and plasma N-antigen level) and host immune markers (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Œ±, IFN-Œ±, IFN-Œ≥, MCP, IP-10, and Spike IgG) over the acute period. Compared to those who fully recovered, those reporting PASC demonstrated significantly higher maximum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and N-antigen, burden of RNA and infectious viral shedding, and lower Spike-specific IgG levels within 9 days post-illness onset. No significant differences were identified among a panel of host immune markers. Our results suggest early viral dynamics and the associated host immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC, highlighting the importance of understanding early biological markers in the natural history of PASC.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Some people who get COVID-19 develop blood clots that can be life-threatening, as well as brain symptoms like memory loss or confusion. This can happen even after they've recovered from the virus. Despite this, scientists still don't fully understand why it happens and there aren't enough treatments.

A protein called fibrin, which helps form blood clots, is found in high amounts in the lungs and brains of people with COVID-19. It's also a good indicator of how severe their symptoms will be and can predict brain problems after they've recovered.

Scientists have discovered that fibrin binds to the COVID-19 virus and forms pro-inflammatory blood clots, which causes more inflammation and damage to the brain and lungs. They've also found that targeting this part of the fibrin protein with a special antibody can help protect against further damage.

This suggests that targeting fibrin could be a new way to treat not only acute COVID-19 but also long-term symptoms after recovery.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Life-threatening thrombotic events and neurological symptoms are prevalent in COVID-19 and are¬†persistent in patients with long COVID experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection1,2,3,4. Despite the clinical evidence1,5,6,7, the underlying mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 and its consequences in inflammation and neuropathology remain poorly understood and treatment options are insufficient. Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits1,5,8,9,10. Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it¬†suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A¬†monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides¬†protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID.</p>

                <p>An unexpected IgE anti-receptor binding domain response following natural infection and different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract that a young person can understand:

When people get infected with COVID-19 or vaccinated against it, their bodies produce special proteins called antibodies to fight the virus. Most research has focused on one type of antibody, but there are other types too. This study looked at a different type of antibody called IgE, which is usually associated with allergies and parasites.

The researchers took blood samples from 59 people in Brazil who had been infected with COVID-19 or vaccinated against it. They found that IgE antibodies were produced after infection and vaccination. The good news was that the vaccines helped increase the levels of these antibodies, making them more effective at fighting the virus.

The study also found that different types of vaccines worked better than others in producing IgE antibodies. However, when people got a booster shot with a third vaccine, their IgE antibody levels became similar across all groups.

Overall, this study suggests that IgE antibodies play an important role in our immune system's response to COVID-19 and viruses, and more research is needed to understand how they work and their potential benefits.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 has been studied, predominantly the classical IgG and its subclasses. Although IgE antibodies are typically specific to allergens or parasites, a few reports describe their production in response to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Here, we investigated IgE specific to receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in a Brazilian cohort following natural infection and vaccination. Samples from 59 volunteers were assessed after infection (COVID-19), primary immunization with vectored (ChAdOx1) or inactivated (CoronaVac) vaccines, and booster immunization with mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine. Natural COVID-19 induced IgE, but vaccination increased its levels. Subjects vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 exhibited a more robust response than those immunized with two doses of CoronaVac; however, after boosting with BNT162b2, all groups presented similar IgE levels. IgE showed intermediate-to-high avidity, especially after the booster vaccine. We also found IgG4 antibodies, mainly after the booster, and they moderately correlated with IgE. ELISA results were confirmed by control assays, using IgG depletion by protein G and lack of reactivity with heterologous antigen. In our cohort, no clinical data could be associated with the IgE response. We advocate for further research on IgE and its role in viral immunity, extending beyond allergies and parasitic infections.</p>

                <p>Antibody Fc receptor binding and T cell responses to homologous and heterologous immunization with inactivated or mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2</p><br>
                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

Two different COVID-19 vaccines, CoronaVac and BNT162b2 (also known as Pfizer-BioNTech), were tested in a study to see how well they worked against severe illness from COVID-19. The results showed that while both vaccines are effective in preventing serious illness, they work differently inside the body.

The researchers looked at how well each vaccine stimulated the immune system to produce antibodies and T cells, which help fight off the virus. They found that:

* BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) booster shots produced more antibodies against COVID-19 than CoronaVac booster shots.
* Participants who received CoronaVac as a first dose had lower levels of certain immune cells called CD4+IFNŒ≥+cells, but this level increased after receiving either CoronaVac or BNT162b2 booster shots.
* The type of vaccine used for the first dose (CoronaVac or Pfizer-BioNTech) influenced which types of T cells and antibodies were produced by the body.

These findings suggest that while both vaccines have their strengths and weaknesses, they can still provide protection against severe COVID-19 illness.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Whole virion inactivated vaccine CoronaVac (C) and Spike (S) mRNA BNT162b2 (B) vaccines differ greatly in their ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies but have somewhat comparable effectiveness in protecting from severe COVID-19. We conducted further analyses for a randomized trial (Cobovax study, NCT05057169) of third dose homologous and heterologous booster vaccination, i.e. four interventions CC-C, CC-B, BB-C and BB-B. Here, we assess vaccine immunogenicity beyond neutralizing function, including S and non-S antibodies with Fc receptor (FcR) binding, antibody avidity and T cell specificity to 6 months post-vaccination. Ancestral and Omicron S-specific IgG and FcR binding are significantly higher by BNT162b2 booster than CoronaVac, regardless of first doses. Nucleocapsid (N) antibodies are only increased in homologous boosted CoronaVac participants (CC-C). CoronaVac primed participants have lower baseline S-specific CD4+IFNŒ≥+cells, but are significantly increased by either CoronaVac or BNT162b2 boosters. Priming vaccine content defined T cell peptide specificity preference, with S-specific T cells dominating B primed groups and non-S structural peptides contributing more in C primed groups, regardless of booster type. S-specific CD4+T cell responses, N-specific antibodies, and antibody effector functions via Fc receptor binding may contribute to protection and compensate for less potent neutralizing responses in CoronaVac recipients.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

When pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19 or catch the virus, their bodies make antibodies that can help protect them and their babies. Researchers studied how well these antibodies worked after different combinations of vaccination and infection during pregnancy.

They found that when women got three doses of the vaccine, it boosted the level of protective antibodies more than just two doses or getting infected with COVID-19 alone. This effect was even stronger when women had both vaccinated and been infected.

The researchers also looked at how well these antibodies were transferred from mother to baby during pregnancy. They found that antibodies made by the vaccine were passed on more efficiently than those made by infection.

These findings suggest that combining vaccination and natural immunity can create a stronger defense against COVID-19 in pregnant women, which is good news for protecting both mom and baby!</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Hybrid immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied in pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) and binding antibodies in pregnant individuals who received mRNA vaccination, natural infection, or both. A third vaccine dose augmented nAb levels compared to the two-dose regimen or natural infection alone; this effect was more pronounced in hybrid immunity. There was reduced anti-Omicron nAb, but the maternal-fetal transfer efficiency remained comparable to that of other variants. Vaccine-induced nAbs were transferred more efficiently than infection-induced nAbs. Anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG was associated with nAb against wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) following breakthrough infection. Both vaccination and infection-induced anti-RBD IgA, which was more durable than anti-nucleocapsid IgA. IgA response was attenuated in pregnancy compared to non-pregnant controls. These data provide additional evidence of augmentation of humoral immune responses in hybrid immunity in pregnancy.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

The COVID-19 vaccine works by using a special part of the virus called the spike (S) to help our bodies fight it. However, the virus can change over time and become harder for the vaccine to recognize. The stable part of the spike is called S2, which doesn't change much and can trigger strong antibodies in our bodies that can protect us against different types of viruses. But, this part of the spike is difficult to keep stable and has been hard to use as a vaccine. We used computer simulations to design a new version of S2 that is more stable and still triggers strong antibodies. Our results show that this new version works well in tests and could be an effective alternative to traditional COVID-19 vaccines.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The full-length prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) is the principal antigen of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine efficacy has been impacted by emerging variants of concern that accumulate most of the sequence modifications in the immunodominant S1 subunit. S2, in contrast, is the most evolutionarily conserved region of the spike and can elicit broadly neutralizing and protective antibodies. Yet, S2‚Äôs usage as an alternative vaccine strategy is hampered by its general instability. Here, we use a simulation-driven approach to design S2-only immunogens stabilized in a closed prefusion conformation. Molecular simulations provide a mechanistic characterization of the S2 trimer‚Äôs opening, informing the design of tryptophan substitutions that impart kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization. Structural characterization via cryo-EM shows the molecular basis of S2 stabilization in the closed prefusion conformation. Informed by molecular simulations and corroborated by experiments, we report an engineered S2 immunogen that exhibits increased protein expression, superior thermostability, and preserved immunogenicity against sarbecoviruses.</p>

                <p>To evaluate the safety and the potential antiviral treatment of inhaled enriched heparin in patients with COVID-19. The specific objectives were to investigate the anticoagulation profile, antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, and respiratory evolution of inhaled enriched heparin. We conducted a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 receiving inhalation of enriched heparin or saline (placebo) every 4¬†h for 7¬†days. Among the 27 patients who completed the study, no changes in blood coagulation parameters were observed, indicating the safety of inhaled enriched heparin. The group receiving enriched heparin showed a significant reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen and improvement in respiratory parameters, such as the PaO2/FiO2ratio. Inhalation of enriched heparin is shown to be safe and has also demonstrated potential therapeutic benefits for patients with COVID-19. These promising results justify the continuation of the study to the next phase, Phase II/III, to further evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled enriched heparin in the treatment of COVID-19-associated viral pneumonia.Trial registration:¬†ClinicalTrials.gov. 08/02/2021.

Researchers have developed a new vaccine called CDO-7N-1 that uses a weakened form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to stimulate an immune response. In laboratory tests, this vaccine has been shown to provide long-lasting protection against different strains of the virus and prevent lung damage. A single dose of the vaccine triggered a strong immune response in mice, hamsters, and macaques, protecting them from infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern.

Despite the success of spike-protein vaccines in preventing severe disease, long-lasting protection against emerging variants and the prevention of breakthrough infections and transmission remain elusive. We generate an intranasal live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CDO-7N-1, using codon deoptimization. CDO-7N-1 shows highly attenuated replication and minimal or no lung pathology in vivo over multiple passages. It induces robust mucosal and systemic neutralizing antibody and T-cell subset responses, in mice (female K18-hACE2 and male HFH4-hACE2 mice), hamsters, and macaques triggered by a single immunization. Mice and hamsters vaccinated with CDO-7N-1 are protected from challenge with wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern. Serum from vaccinated animals neutralizes WT SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern (beta and delta), variants of interest (omicron XBB.1.5) and SARS-CoV-1. Antibody responses are sustained and enhanced by repeated immunization or infection with WT SARS-CoV-2. Immunity against all SARS-CoV-2 proteins by CDO-7N-1 should improve efficacy against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), is a condition where people experience ongoing problems after having COVID-19. It can make it hard for them to contribute to society. To understand why this happens, researchers studied the lung proteins in hamsters infected with an early version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They found that at 3 and 5 days after infection, many lung proteins changed in both male and female hamsters. However, by day 31 (when no virus was left), they saw differences between the sexes, including some proteins that were lower or higher in males than females. The researchers also found that biological sex should be considered when developing treatments for PASC because of these differences.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remains an ongoing public health issue that causes impairment for those afflicted and diminishes their ability to contribute to society. To address the host response underpinning respiratory PASC, we used the Golden Syrian hamster model infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and examined its lung proteome in a longitudinal experiment. We infected young 6-week old male and female hamsters with 105TCID50of virus via the intranasal route and sampled the lung at 1, 3, 5, and 31 days post infection (dpi). We compared the infected lung proteome to that of uninfected sex-matched controls. We found almost no differences in protein levels at 1 dpi, with hundreds at 3 dpi, and thousands at 5 dpi. Many overlapping differential protein levels and pathways were seen in both sexes at 3 and 5 dpi including the Coagulation and Complement cascades. Notably, we found differences between the sexes at 31 dpi which included many targets with decreased levels of protein in the males. We also noted an increase in 7 proteins in both sexes at 31 dpi including proteins responsible for airway mucosal layer integrity such as Mucin 5B and Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1. Longitudinally, 38 proteins were changed in levels across more than one timepoint in the males but only three proteins were in the females, Secretoglobin family 1‚ÄâA member 1, Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase, and Apolipoprotein D. Overall, we show that there are changes to the lung proteome at 31 dpi, a time when no SARS-CoV-2 remains, and that there are sex differences in that proteome after infection with the ancestral strain. We conclude that biological sex should be examined as a variable when testing medical countermeasures for PASC in the Golden Syrian hamster due to host differences between the sexes.</p>

                <p>ü§ñ <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a simplified version of the abstract:

As we get older, our bodies become more vulnerable to severe illnesses like COVID-19. The connection between age, existing health problems, and COVID-19 is not fully understood. This study used a special mouse model that ages quickly to see how COVID-19 affects different age groups.

The results showed that younger mice can fight off the virus easily, but older mice have a weaker response and are more likely to get very sick and die. The mouse model with premature aging showed milder symptoms, but still had some problems with their immune system and metabolism.

By studying how COVID-19 affects these mice, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of why some people are more susceptible to severe illness and develop new treatments for COVID-19 and other diseases related to aging.</p><br>
                <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>Aging is identified as a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), often resulting in profound lung damage and mortality. Yet, the biological relationship between aging, aging-related comorbidities, and COVID-19 remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the age-related COVID19 pathogenesis using an Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) mouse model, a premature aging disease model, with humanized ACE2 receptors. Pathological features were compared between young, aged, and HGPS hACE2 mice following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We demonstrated that young mice display robust interferon response and antiviral activity, whereas this response is attenuated in aged mice. Viral infection in aged mice results in severe respiratory tract hemorrhage, likely contributing a higher mortality rate. In contrast, HGPS hACE2 mice exhibit milder disease manifestations characterized by minor immune cell infiltration and dysregulation of multiple metabolic processes. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed both shared and unique gene expression dynamics among different mouse groups. Collectively, our studies evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on progeroid syndromes using a HGPS hACE2 mouse model, which holds promise as a useful tool for investigating COVID-19 pathogenesis in individuals with premature aging.</p>
