    <strong>Covid Fox Monitoring</strong> <br>
    <span class="subtext">A Covid Wastewater  Project</span>
</p>

## Project Direction
#### There are several <b>aims</b> that I want to fulfill with this project.<br>
* Give People An Overview of Current Covid Transmission Levels
* Collect & Share Data Sources for people to use for their Covid-projects
<br><br>
#### In order to fulfill these aims the current project direction is <br>
* Find Datalinks to Covid Wastewater Data
* Find ways to use social media data <span style="color: DarkOrange;">üî®üë∑üöß‚ö†Ô∏è  In Progress</span>
* Find ways to pull aggregated google trends search terms data by region
* Find ways to pull aggregated mobility data per region
* Forecast covid transmission per region 1-4+ weeks ahead
<br><br>
#### Reliability of The Project
* Find ways of better hosting (URGENT - Exceeding free github tier)  <span style="color: green;">&#10004; Completed</span>
* Data Quality Control 
* Implementation of proper CI/CD pipeline
* Testing prior to releases
* Full automation of independent daily updates
<br><br>

#### Outside of Scope (Currently)
* Simulations of NPI's & transmission level
<br><br>
<br><br>
#### Please Note: The graphs and data are to be interpreted carefully.

### Colorization Rule (Current)
<b>Interpretation</b>
* <b>Sweden:</b> Red = "High Transmission". Based on the height of Uppsala wastewater measures during wave 1 2020.
* <b>All Other Countries:</b> Red = "Relatively High Transmission". Based on each country separately relative to the Min-Max values in the timeperiod.
* <b>Withinin</b> country comparisons can be made.
* <b>Between</b> country comparisons should <i>ONLY</i> be made with careful interpretation. The colors are relative, so I *believe* only relative time dimension interpretations are possible. NOT degree of transmission on a specific week. The reason is that almost each country uses different metrics to track transmission.

<br>

The Heuristic of the Swedish Cut-off Value of 10 and above indicated as "high transmission" (red).

## Trendline Charts
Later some trend graphs might be added too (geo higher prioritized to be implemented).
Later might add trendgraphs too. The trick is to figure out how to create a concise & intuitive overview.
