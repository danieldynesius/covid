A Work in Progress - Visualizing Wastewater data.


#### Please Note: The graphs and data are to be interpreted carefully.

### Current Status

### Colorization Rule (Current)
<b>Interpretation</b>
* <b>Sweden:</b> Red = "High Transmission". Based on the height of Uppsala wastewater measures during wave 1 2020.
* <b>All Other Countries:</b> Red = "Relatively High Transmission". Based on each country separately relative to the Min-Max values in the timeperiod.
* <b>Withinin</b> country comparisons can be made.
* <b>Between</b> country comparisons should <i>ONLY</i> be made with careful interpretation. The colors are relative, so I *believe* only relative time dimension interpretations are possible. NOT degree of transmission on a specific week. The reason is that almost each country uses different metrics to track transmission.

<br>

The Heuristic of the Swedish Cut-off Value of 10 and above indicated as "high transmission" (red).

## Trendline Charts
Later some trend graphs might be added too (geo higher prioritized to be implemented).
Later might add trendgraphs too. The trick is to figure out how to create a concise & intuitive overview.
