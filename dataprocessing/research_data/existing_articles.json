        "abstract":"Although young children generally experience mild symptoms following infection with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute and long-term complications can occur. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines elicit robust immunoglobulin profiles in children ages 5 years and older, and in adults, corresponding with substantial protection against hospitalizations and severe disease. Whether similar immune responses and humoral protection can be observed in vaccinated infants and young children, who have a developing and vulnerable immune system, remains poorly understood. To study the impact of mRNA vaccination on the humoral immunity of infant, we use a system serology approach to comprehensively profile antibody responses in a cohort of children ages 6 months to 5 years who were vaccinated with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (25\u2009\u03bcg). Responses are compared with vaccinated adults (100\u2009\u03bcg), in addition to naturally infected toddlers and young children. Despite their lower vaccine dose, vaccinated toddlers elicit a functional antibody response as strong as adults, with higher antibody-dependent phagocytosis compared to adults, without report of side effects. Moreover, mRNA vaccination is associated with a higher IgG3-dependent humoral profile against SARS-CoV-2 compared to natural infection, supporting that mRNA vaccination is effective at eliciting a robust antibody response in toddlers and young children.",

        "abstract":"Omicron emerged following COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, displaced previous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern worldwide, and gave rise to lineages that continue to spread. Here, we show that Omicron exhibits increased infectivity in primary adult upper airway tissue relative to Delta. Using recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 and nasal epithelial cells cultured at the liquid-air interface, we show that mutations unique to Omicron Spike enable enhanced entry into nasal tissue. Unlike earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, our findings suggest that Omicron enters nasal cells independently of serine transmembrane proteases and instead relies upon metalloproteinases to catalyze membrane fusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this entry pathway unlocked by Omicron Spike enables evasion from constitutive and interferon-induced antiviral factors that restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry following attachment. Therefore, the increased transmissibility exhibited by Omicron in humans may be attributed not only to its evasion of vaccine-elicited adaptive immunity, but also to its superior invasion of nasal epithelia and resistance to the cell-intrinsic barriers present therein.",

Here, we identify a highly conserved neutralizing epitope targeted by a broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody BA7535, which demonstrates high neutralization potency against not only previous variants, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron BA.1-BA.5, but also more recently emerged Omicron subvariants, including BF.7, CH.1.1, XBB.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9.1, EG.5. Structural analysis of the Omicron Spike trimer with BA7535-Fab using cryo-EM indicates that BA7535 recognizes a highly conserved cryptic receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitope, avoiding most of the mutational hot spots in RBD. Furthermore, structural simulation based on the interaction of BA7535-Fab\/RBD complexes dissects the broadly neutralizing effect of BA7535 against latest variants. Therapeutic and prophylactic treatment with BA7535 alone or in combination with BA7208 protected female mice from the circulating Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1 variant infection, suggesting the highly conserved neutralizing epitope serves as a potential target for developing highly potent therapeutic antibodies and vaccines.",

Recommendations that include cycle threshold (Ct) cutoffs may incentivize early retesting when the Ct value is reported. We aimed to investigate patterns of retesting in association with initial Ct-values. We performed a retrospective analysis of RT-PCR results (including Ct-values) for patients from whom \u2265\u20092 samples were collected within 14\u00a0days, the first of which had to be positive. We calculated absolute and baseline-corrected kinetics of Ct-values over time, as well as the median initial Ct-values in dependence of the timing of the first retesting and the time until RT-PCR negativity for SARS-CoV-2. Retesting after an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was most commonly performed on day 7, with patients being retested as early as day 1. The majority of patients retested within 14\u00a0days remained SARS-CoV-2 positive in the RT-PCR. Baseline-corrected Ct-values showed a quasi-linear increase over 14\u00a0days since the initial positive result. Both the timing until the first retesting and until RT-PCR negativity were inversely correlated with the initial Ct-value. The timing of retesting after a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR appears to be significantly influenced by the initial Ct-value. Although it can be assumed that Ct-values will increase steadily over time, strategies that rely on rigid Ct-cutoffs should be discussed critically, not only because of methodological caveats but also because of the strain on testing infrastructure caused by the incentive for early retesting that Ct-values apparently represent.",

        "abstract":"SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells are detected in some healthy unexposed individuals. Human studies indicate these T cells could be elicited by the common cold coronavirus OC43. To directly test this assumption and define the role of OC43-elicited T cells that are cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2, we develop a model of sequential infections with OC43 followed by SARS-CoV-2 in HLA-B*0702 and HLA-DRB1*0101Ifnar1\u2212\/\u2212transgenic mice. We find that OC43 infection can elicit polyfunctional CD8+and CD4+effector T cells that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Furthermore, pre-exposure to OC43 reduces subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in the lung for a short-term in HLA-DRB1*0101Ifnar1\u2212\/\u2212transgenic mice, and a longer-term in HLA-B*0702Ifnar1\u2212\/\u2212transgenic mice. Depletion of CD4+T cells in HLA-DRB1*0101Ifnar1\u2212\/\u2212transgenic mice with prior OC43 exposure results in increased viral burden in the lung but no change in virus-induced lung damage following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (versus CD4+T cell-sufficient mice), demonstrating that the OC43-elicited SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cell-mediated cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 is partially dependent on CD4+T cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of the origin of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells and their effects on SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes, and also carry implications for development of broadly protective betacoronavirus vaccines.",

Two-hundred and twenty-one mothers with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 227 exposed fetuses are enrolled in our study. Maternal disease severity and neonatal RD variables were defined based on current accepted clinical criteria. To explore the multifactorial associations between maternal COVID-19 parameters and infant RD, we utilize a multivariable logistic regression model and a proteomic sub-analysis to propose a pathway for the development of RD followingin uteroexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Unusually high rates of RD are observed in SEU infants (17%). The odds ratio of RD is 3.06 (95% CI:1.08-10.21) in term neonates born to unvaccinated individuals versus those born to individuals vaccinated prior to maternal infection.

We investigate the conformational dynamics and stabilizing features using orthogonal SPR, SEC, nanoDSF, and HDX-MS techniques to better understand how this antigen elicits superior broad neutralizing antibodies as a variant booster vaccine.

The region with the largest expected D will have the highest ranking.\n\nAnswer: \nThe answer would depend on the specific numbers provided for each region's population size and infection rates in step 1. Once these are known, follow the steps above to compute the ranks.",

You encounter four users each with different understanding levels. User A is a medical student, User B has a background in sports science, User C works as a personal trainer and User D is new to the field of exercise science.\n\nHere's the challenge: you have to explain the above research abstract, but tailor your explanation to each user's level of scientific understanding. You know that User A will understand the concept of how exercise affects the brain, User B can grasp the relationship between blood flow and neuron growth, User C can understand why this matters in their work as a personal trainer, and User D needs a simplified version for beginners.\n\nQuestion: How would you explain this abstract to each user?\n\n\nFirst, break down the information into simpler terms. For User A, explain that exercise increases blood flow to the brain which promotes growth of new neurons (brain cells). This can help with memory and cognitive function. \n\nFor User B, emphasize how this is similar to training a muscle - when you exert yourself during physical activity, your heart pumps more oxygen-rich blood to your muscles for them to grow stronger. In the brain, this means increased neuron growth leads to improved cognitive function.\n\nTo explain to User C, tie in their experience as a personal trainer: Regular exercise improves not only physical health but mental acuity too! It's like training the heart - by exercising regularly, you increase blood flow to the brain and encourage the development of new neurons. This is why it's so important for fitness routines!\n\nFor User D, use simple language: Exercise makes your brain stronger! Just like how when you work out, your muscles grow, when you exercise, your heart sends more blood and 'brain food' to the brain, making it better at thinking and remembering things. \n\nAnswer: To explain this abstract to each user, you need to simplify complex scientific concepts by using examples that users can relate to - like training a muscle or increasing cognitive function through regular exercise. By doing so, the information becomes more accessible and understandable for users of different knowledge levels.

They also know that each compound has a different chemical structure. \n\nThe Computational Chemist 1, using computer simulations, predicts that Compound A will bind with the main protease better than Compound B or C. The computational chemist 2, who's working on X-ray crystallography, argues that Compound B is more stable and efficient in blocking the enzyme activity compared to A. Lastly, a Computational Chemist 3 says that Compound C has potential as an inhibitor due to its unique molecular structure, despite not being as effective as A or B according to their respective analyses.\n\nHere are some additional pieces of information:\n- If Compound A is more effective than Compound B, then it's also less stable and efficient compared to Compound C. \n- Compound B is not the least effective in inhibiting enzyme activity.\n- Only one Chemist\u2019s prediction was accurate.\n\nQuestion: Who was correct?\n\n\n\nLet's start by understanding the information given: \n1) The first statement suggests a transitive property, if A > B and A < C then B > C. But since we don't know the value of 'A' in this context, it can't be concluded that Compound A is less effective than Compound C. This means the first statement doesn\u2019t provide enough information to conclusively prove or disprove the second.\n2) The second statement implies that Compound B is more effective than at least one other compound (A or C). \n3) The third statement says Compound C is less effective than A and B, but it's still potential. This indicates that while Compound C isn't as efficient or stable as the others, it does show some effectiveness in inhibiting the enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2. \n\n\nBy inductive logic and proof by contradiction:\nWe know only one Chemist\u2019s prediction was accurate and the first statement doesn't provide enough information to confirm any Chemist's prediction. We also know that Compound B is more effective than at least one other compound (A or C) but it isn't clear if this makes Compound B the most effective or not. \nApplying proof by contradiction, assuming none of them are correct contradicts our initial assumption that only one Chemist\u2019s prediction was accurate. Hence, we can conclude that all three chemists were partially right because each has given some information about a compound's potential as an inhibitor to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAnswer: All three Computational Chemists were partially correct; their predictions provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and stability of Compound A, B and C as inhibitors for the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in severe respiratory illness and can lead to significant complications in affected individuals. These complications encompass symptoms such as coughing, respiratory distress, fever, infectious shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even multiple-organ failure. Animal models serve as crucial tools for investigating pathogenic mechanisms, immune responses, immune escape mechanisms, antiviral drug development, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Currently, various animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as nonhuman primates (NHPs), ferrets, hamsters, and many different mouse models, have been developed. Each model possesses distinctive features and applications. In this review, we elucidate the immune response elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and provide an overview of the characteristics of various animal models mainly used for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the corresponding immune responses and applications of these models. A comparative analysis of transcriptomic alterations in the lungs from different animal models revealed that the K18-hACE2 and mouse-adapted virus mouse models exhibited the highest similarity with the deceased COVID-19 patients.

We examine discrete cell subtypes and continuous cell states longitudinally, and we identify upregulation of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as the predominant early signature of subsequent worsening of symptoms, which we validate in an independent cohort and corroborate by plasma markers. However, ISG expression is dynamic in progressors, spiking early and then rapidly receding to the level of severity-matched non-progressors. In contrast, cross-sectional analysis shows that ISG expression is deficient and IFN suppressors such asSOCS3are upregulated in severe and critical COVID-19. We validate the latter in four independent cohorts, andSOCS3inhibition reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.

Using a library of LNPs encapsulating unique barcoded DNA (b-DNA), we screen for b-DNA delivery after intramuscular administration. The top-performing LNPs are further tested for their capacity of pDNA uptake in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. The lead LNP is used to encapsulate pDNA encoding the HexaPro version of SARS-CoV-2 spike (LNP-HPS) and immunogenicity and protection is tested in vivo. LNP-HPS elicit a robust protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 Gamma (P.1), correlating with reduced lethality, decreased viral load in the lungs and reduced lung damage. LNP-HPS induce potent humoral and T cell responses against P.1, and generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies against P.1 and Omicron (B.1.1.529).

The availability of benchmark testing in combination with advice for improvement substantially enhanced the quality of the laboratory testing procedures for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

We discovered that subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 have improved their suppression of innate immunity when compared with earlier subvariants BA.1 and BA.2. Similarly, more recent subvariants (BA.2.75 and XBB lineages) also triggered reduced innate immune activation. This correlated with increased expression of viral innate antagonists Orf6 and nucleocapsid, reminiscent of VOCs Alpha to Delta.

Notably, asymptomatic infections are characterized by an early and robust innate immune response, particularly a swift type 1 IFN reaction, alongside a rapid and broad induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Often, antibody levels tend to be lower or undetectable after asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the rapid control of viral replication by innate and cellular responses might impede the full triggering of humoral immunity.

A molecular docking study demonstrated that compounds5,11, and12have the best binders of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme, with energy scores of\u2009\u2212\u20097.5\u00a0kcal\/mol,\u2009\u2212\u20097.2\u00a0kcal\/mol, and\u2009\u2212\u20097.9\u00a0kcal\/mol, respectively. The net binding energy values of the 11-Mpro, 12-Mpro, and 5-Mpro complexes revealed their highly stable nature in terms of both intermolecular interactions and docked conformation across the simulation time. ADME properties, besides the pharmacokinetics and Lipinski rules, showed that all seven newly synthesized compounds follow Lipinski rules with high GI absorption. The In Vitro antiviral study against SARS-CoV-2 using MTT methods confirms that compound5has more potential and is safer than other tested compounds. The study shows that the newly synthesized pyridine derivatives have medicinal properties against SARS-CoV-2 without violating Lipinski rules. Compounds5,11,and12, particularly compound5,may serve as promising potential candidate for COVID-19.",

You are an Agricultural Scientist working on the development of genetically modified crops to reduce the impact of diseases like COVID-19 on global agriculture. \n2. The three variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) have been affecting different regions of the world at varying rates. \n3. In these regions, there are three distinct types of CRP alleles - CC, CT, and TT, with each type being dominant in one region. \n4. Alpha variant is more prevalent in regions where C-C allele is dominant, Beta variant is most common in CT genotype areas, and Gamma variant thrives the most in TT genotype zones.\n5. Your objective is to predict the next variant of SARS-CoV-2 based on the predominant CRP type in a given region. \n\n\nQuestion: Considering the rules above, if a new disease outbreak starts in a CT genotype zone where Beta variant is currently dominant, which will be the likely next variants to emerge and why?\n\n\nFirst, identify the genetic makeup of the region's population that is most prevalent with the CT genotype. According to the puzzle, this indicates that the Beta variant is most common in these areas.\n\nNext, recall that the Alpha variant is more dominant in regions where C-C allele is found and Gamma variant thrives the most in TT genotype zones.

Biologically active and antigenic Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD, as well as mutated RBD variants found in nature, were successfully displayed on filamentous phages.

Thereby the innate antiviral immune response is suppressed robustly.

Importantly, the widespread SARS2-NP R203K mutation gains a novel site of SUMOylation which further increases SARS2-NP\u2019s LLPS and immunosuppression. Notably, the SUMO E3 ligase TRIM28 is responsible for catalyzing SARS2-NP SUMOylation.

Here we describe the antibody response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with the Army Liposomal Formulation including QS21 (ALFQ) in non-human primates. By isolating and characterizing several monoclonal antibodies directed against the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), N-Terminal Domain (NTD), or the S2 Domain, we define the molecular recognition of vaccine-elicited cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) elicited by SpFN. We identify six neutralizing antibodies with broad sarbecovirus cross-reactivity that recapitulate serum polyclonal antibody responses. In particular, RBD mAb WRAIR-5001 binds to the conserved cryptic region with high affinity to sarbecovirus clades 1 and 2, including Omicron variants, while\u00a0mAb WRAIR-5021 offers complete protection from B.1.617.2 (Delta) in a murine challenge study.

Self-reported symptom frequencies and blood samples were collected weekly, with plasma assessed by ELISA and Luminex for multiple biomarkers and immune cell profiling. DNA from stool samples were collected at the early stage of recovery for baseline assessments of gut microbial composition and diversity using 16S-based metagenomic sequencing. Multiple regression analyses revealed obesity-related PASC linked to a sustained proinflammatory immune profile and reduced adaptive immunity, corresponding with reduced gut microbial diversity. In particular, enhanced signaling of the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein was found to associate with this dysregulation, with its upregulated levels in plasma associated with significantly impaired viral neutralization that was exacerbated with obesity. These findings implicate HMGB1 as a candidate biomarker of PASC, with potential applications for risk assessment and targeted therapies.",

We conducted an open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands between June and December 2021. One hundred and fifty healthy and SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve participants, aged 18\u201330 years, were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either two doses of 20\u2009\u00b5g mRNA-1273 ID with a standard needle (SN) or the Bella-mu\u00ae needle (BM), or two doses of 100\u2009\u00b5g IM, 28 days apart. The primary outcome was non-inferiority in seroconversion rates at day 43 (D43), defined as a neutralizing antibody concentration threshold of 465\u2009IU\/mL, the lowest response in the IM group. The non-inferiority margin was set at \u221215%. Neutralizing antibody concentrations at D43 were 1789 (95% CI: 1488\u20132150) in the IM and 1263 (951\u20131676) and 1295 (1020\u20131645) in the ID-SN and ID-BM groups, respectively.

Although ID vaccination with 1\/5th dose of mRNA-1273 did not meet the predefined non-inferior criteria, the neutralizing antibody concentrations in these groups are far above the proposed proxy for protection against severe disease (100\u2009IU\/mL), justifying this strategy in times of vaccine scarcity to accelerate mass protection against severe disease.",
