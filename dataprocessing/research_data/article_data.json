            "The ideal vaccines for combating diseases that may emerge in the future require more than simply inactivating a few pathogenic strains. This study aims to provide a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine effective against various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strains. To design the vaccine, a library of peptides from the spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope structural proteins of various strains was prepared. Then, the final vaccine structure was optimized using the fully protected epitopes and the fynomer scaffold. Using bioinformatics tools, the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties, population coverage, and secondary and three-dimensional structures of the vaccine candidate were evaluated. The bioinformatic analyses confirmed the high quality of the vaccine. According to further investigations, this structure is similar to native protein and there is a stable and strong interaction between vaccine and receptors. Based on molecular dynamics simulation, structural compactness and stability in binding were also observed. In addition, the immune simulation showed that the vaccine can stimulate immune responses similar to real conditions. Finally, codon optimization and in silico cloning confirmed efficient expression inEscherichia coli. In conclusion, the fynomer-based vaccine can be considered as a new style in designing and updating vaccines to protect against coronavirus disease."

            "Whole virus-based inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide have been critical to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Although these vaccines are protective against homologous coronavirus infection, the emergence of novel variants and the presence of large zoonotic reservoirs harboring novel heterologous coronaviruses provide significant opportunities for vaccine breakthrough, which raises the risk of adverse outcomes like vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. Here, we use a female mouse model of coronavirus disease to evaluate inactivated vaccine performance against either homologous challenge with SARS-CoV-2 or heterologous challenge with a bat-derived coronavirus that represents a potential emerging disease threat. We show that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide can cause enhanced respiratory disease during heterologous infection, while use of an alternative adjuvant does not drive disease and promotes heterologous viral clearance. In this work, we highlight the impact of adjuvant selection on inactivated vaccine safety and efficacy against heterologous coronavirus infection."

Here, to address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a cohort study of healthy 5\u201312-year-olds vaccinated with BNT162b2. We serially measured binding and neutralizing antibody titers (nAbs), spike-specific memory B cell (MBC) and spike-reactive T cell responses over 1 year. We found that children mounted antibody, MBC and T cell responses after two doses of BNT162b2, with higher antibody and T cell responses than adults 6 months after vaccination. A booster (third) dose only improved antibody titers without impacting MBC and T cell responses. Among children with hybrid immunity, nAbs and T cell responses were highest in those infected after two vaccine doses. Binding IgG titers, MBC and T cell responses were predictive, with T cells being the most important predictor of protection against symptomatic infection before hybrid immunity; nAbs only correlated with protection after hybrid immunity. The stable MBC and T cell responses over time suggest sustained protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, even when nAbs wane. Booster vaccinations do not confer additional immunological protection to healthy children."

The primary objective of the current study is to explore the impact of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection on young people 12 months post infection. 345 CYP aged 11\u201317\u00a0years with a first laboratory-confirmed infection with the Omicron variant and 360 CYP reinfected with the Omicron variant completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, symptoms, and their impact shortly after testing and again at 3-, 6-and 12-months post-testing. Vaccination status was determined from information held at UKHSA. Comparisons between groups were made using chi-squared, Mann\u2013Whitney U, and Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests. The most common symptoms in first-positive and reinfected CYP 12-months post-testing were tiredness (35.7 and 33.6% respectively) and sleeping difficulties (27.5 and 28.3% respectively). Symptom profiles, severity and impact were similar in the two infection status groups. Overall, by 12-months, 17.4% of first-positives and 21.9% of reinfected CYP fulfilled the research consensus Long Covid definition (p=\u20090.13). 12-months post Omicron infection, there is little difference between first-positive and reinfected CYP with respect to symptom profiles and impact. Clinicians may not therefore need to consider number of infections and type of variant when developing treatment plans. Further studies are needed to assess causality of reported symptoms up to 12-months after SARS-CoV-2 infection."

            "Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variant strains with altered characteristics have emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir (RDV), a ribonucleotide analogue inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase, has become a valuable therapeutic agent. However, immunosuppressed hosts may respond inadequately to RDV and develop chronic persistent infections. A patient with respiratory failure caused by interstitial pneumonia, who had undergone transplantation of the left lung, developed COVID-19 caused by Omicron BA.5 strain with persistent chronic viral shedding, showing viral fusogenicity. Genome-wide sequencing analyses revealed the occurrence of several viral mutations after RDV treatment, followed by dynamic changes in the viral populations. The C799F mutation in nsp12 was found to play a pivotal role in conferring RDV resistance, preventing RDV-triphosphate from entering the active site of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The occurrence of diverse mutations is a characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, which mutates frequently. Herein, we describe the clinical case of an immunosuppressed host in whom inadequate treatment resulted in highly diverse SARS-CoV-2 mutations that threatened the patient\u2019s health due to the development of drug-resistant variants."

            "Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or the continuation of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) symptoms past 12\u00a0weeks may affect as many as 30% of people recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) infection. The mechanisms regulating the development of PASC are currently not known; however, hypotheses include virus reservoirs, pre-existing conditions, microblood clots, immune dysregulation, as well as poor antibody responses. Importantly, virus neutralizing antibodies are essential for COVID-19 recovery and protection from reinfection but there is currently limited information on these immune regulators and associated cytokines in PASC patients. Understanding the key drivers of general and specific symptoms associated with Long COVID and the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies in PASC will aid in the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines which currently do not exist. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate systemic antibody and cytokine responses during COVID-19 recovery and PASC. In total, 195 participants were recruited in one of four groups: (1) Those who never had COVID-19 (No COVID); (2) Those in acute COVID-19 recovery (Acute Recovery) (4\u201312\u00a0weeks post infection); (3) Those who recovered from COVID-19 (Recovered) (+\u200912\u00a0weeks from infection); and (4) those who had PASC (PASC) (+\u200912\u00a0weeks from infection). Participants completed a questionnaire on health history, sex, gender, demographics, experiences with COVID-19 acute and COVID-19 recovery\/continuing symptoms. Serum samples collected were evaluated for antibody binding to viral proteins, virus neutralizing antibody titers, and serum cytokine levels using Ella SimplePlex Immunoassay\u2122 panels. We found participants with PASC reported more pre-existing conditions (e.g. such as hypertension, asthma, and obesity), and PASC symptoms (e.g. fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and shortness of breath) following COVID-19 than COVID-19 Recovered individuals. Importantly, we found PASC individuals to have significantly decreased levels of neutralizing antibodies toward both SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.1 variant. Sex analysis indicated that female PASC study participants had sustained antibody levels as well as levels of the inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF and ANG-2 over time following COVID-19. Our study reports people experiencing PASC had lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies; however, the results are limited by the collection time post-COVID-19 and post-vaccination. Moreover, we found females experiencing PASC had sustained levels of GM-CSF and ANG-2. With lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies, this data suggests that PASC individuals not only have had a suboptimal antibody response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but may also have increased susceptibility to subsequent infections which may exacerbate or prolong current PASC illnesses. We also provide evidence suggesting GM-CSF and ANG-2 to play a role in the sex-bias of PASC. Taken together, our findings maybe important for understanding immune molecular drivers of PASC and PASC subgroups."

In this multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, phase 3 study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u2013na\u00efve participants (aged\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years, without prior infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2) were randomized (1:1) to receive either S-268019-b or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 as two intramuscular injections given 28\u00a0days apart. Participants who provided consent for a booster administration received S-268019-b at Day 211. The primary endpoint was SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer on Day 57; the key secondary endpoint was the seroconversion rate for SARS-CoV-2 NAb titer on Day 57. Other endpoints included anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 S-protein immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody titer and safety.

S-268019-b showed superior immunogenicity over ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, based on their geometric mean titers (GMTs) and GMT ratios of SARS-CoV-2 NAb on Day 57 by cytopathic effect assay (GMT [95% confidence interval {CI}] 19.92 [18.68, 21.23] versus 3.63 [3.41, 3.87]; GMT ratio [95% CI] 5.48 [5.01, 6.00], respectively; two-sidedp-values\u2009<\u20090.0001).

Notably, immune responses were durable through the end of the study. S-268019-b elicited T-helper 1 skewed T-cell response, comparable to that of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. After the first dose, the incidence of solicited systemic treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was higher in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, but after the second dose, the incidence was higher in the S-268019-b group. Headache, fatigue, and myalgia were the most commonly reported solicited systemic TRAEs, while pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local TRAE following both doses in both groups. No serious treatment-related adverse serious TRAEs events were reported in the two groups. S-268019-b was more immunogenic than ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and was well tolerated (jRCT2051210151)."

        "abstract":[
            "The Covid-19 pandemic outbreak has accelerated tremendous efforts to discover a therapeutic strategy that targets severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control viral infection. Various viral proteins have been identified as potential drug targets, however, to date, no specific therapeutic cure is available against the SARS-CoV-2. To address this issue, the present work reports a systematic cheminformatic approach to identify the potent andrographolide derivatives that can target methyltransferases of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. nsp14 and nsp16 which are crucial for the replication of the virus and host immune evasion. A consensus of cheminformatics methodologies including virtual screening, molecular docking, ADMET profiling, molecular dynamics simulations, free-energy landscape analysis, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA), and density functional theory (DFT) was utilized. Our study reveals two new andrographolide derivatives (PubChem CID: 2734589 and 138968421) as natural bioactive molecules that can form stable complexes with both proteins via hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The toxicity analysis predicts class four toxicity for both compounds with LD50value in the range of 500\u2013700\u00a0mg\/kg. MD simulation reveals the stable formation of the complex for both the compounds and their average trajectory values were found to be lower than the control inhibitor and protein alone. MMGBSA analysis corroborates the MD simulation result and showed the lowest energy for the compounds 2734589 and 138968421. The DFT and MEP analysis also predicts the better reactivity and stability of both the hit compounds. Overall, both andrographolide derivatives exhibit good potential as potent inhibitors for both nsp14 and nsp16 proteins, however, in-vitro and in vivo assessment would be required to prove their efficacy and safety in clinical settings. Moreover, the drug discovery strategy aiming at the dual target approach might serve as a useful model for inventing novel drug molecules for various other diseases."

            "It is well known the potential of severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to induce post-acute sequelae, a condition called Long COVID. This syndrome includes several symptoms, but the central nervous system (CNS) main one is neurocognitive dysfunction. Recently it has been demonstrated the relevance of plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (pNfL), as a biomarker of early involvement of the CNS in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pNfL in patients with post-acute neurocognitive symptoms and the potential of NfL as a prognostic biomarker in these cases. A group of 63 long COVID patients ranging from 18 to 59 years-old were evaluated, submitted to a neurocognitive battery assessment, and subdivided in different groups, according to results. Plasma samples were collected during the long COVID assessment and used for measurement of pNfL with the Single molecule array (SIMOA) assays. Levels of pNfL were significantly higher in long COVID patients with neurocognitive symptoms when compared to HC (p=\u20090.0031). Long COVID patients with cognitive impairment and fatigue symptoms presented higher pNfL levels when compared to long COVID patients without these symptoms, individually and combined (p=\u20090.0263,p=\u20090.0480, and 0.0142, respectively). Correlation analysis showed that levels of cognitive lost and exacerbation of fatigue in the neurocognitive evaluation had a significative correlation with higher pNfL levels (p=\u20090.0219 and 0.0255, respectively). Previous reports suggested that pNfL levels are related with higher risk of severity and predict lethality of COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a long-term impact on the brain, even in patients who presented mild acute disease. NfL measurements might be useful to identify CNS involvement in long COVID associated with neurocognitive symptoms and to identify who will need continuous monitoring and treatment support."

In mice, the vaccination elicited RBD-specific broad-neutralizing antibody responses in both serum and mucosal sites sustained at high level over a year. This long-lasting humoral immunity was correlated with the presence of long-lived RBD-specific IgG- and IgA-producing plasma cells, alongside the Th17 and Tfh17-biased T-cell responses driven by the KFD adjuvant. Based upon these preclinical findings, an open labeled clinical trial was conducted in individuals who had been primed with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (IAV) vaccine. With a favorable safety profile, the3R-NC+KFDi.nboost elicited enduring broad-neutralizing IgG in plasma and IgA in salivary secretions. To meet the challenge of frequently emerged variants, we further designed an updated triple-RBD scaffold protein with mutated RBD combinations, which can induce adaptable antibody responses to neutralize the newly emerging variants, including JN.1.

            "Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing outbreak, disrupting human life worldwide. Vaccine development was prioritized to obtain a biological substance for combating the viral pathogen and lessening disease severity. In vaccine production, biological origin and relevant materials must be carefully examined for potential contaminants in conformity with good manufacturing practice. Due to fast mutation, several SARS-CoV-2 variants and sublineages have been identified. Currently, most of COVID-19 vaccines are developed based on the protein sequence of the Wuhan wild type strain. New vaccines specific for emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously needed to tackle the incessant evolution of the virus. Therefore, in vaccine development and production, a reliable method to identify the nature of subunit vaccines is required to avoid cross-contamination. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using quadrupole-time of flight along with tryptic digestion was developed for distinguishing protein materials derived from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. After analyzing the recombinantly produced receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nine characteristic peptides were identified with acceptable limits of detection. They can be used together to distinguish 14 SARS-CoV-2 strains, except Kappa and Epsilon. Plant-produced RBD-Fc protein derived from Omicron strains can be easily distinguished from the others with 4\u20135 unique peptides. Eventually, a peptide key was developed based on the nine peptides, offering a prompt and precise flowchart to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 strain identification in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing."

Overall, environmental factors (e.g., ventilation, humidity and temperature) were assessed to be appropriate at the facility. Nevertheless, 39 (51.3%) surface samples from across the site tested positive for low\/ very low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct value\u2009\u2265\u200932.0 for all). Among the study participants, of whom 35.6% were confirmed or suspected cases, 95.5% reported having received COVID-19 prevention training, 100.0% reported handwashing, and 80.0% reported use of face coverings at work. Notably, 43.9% and 19.0% reported working with a symptomatic and a positive contact respectively. Furthermore, 80.5% and 46.3% had concerns regarding reduction in their income and future unemployment, respectively, due to self-isolation. The findings of this study suggest that, in addition to targeted workplace infection control measures and tailored work area specific risk assessments, an enhanced and equitable sick leave policy may help limit presenteeism and viral transmission in large workplaces."

            "Inflammasome assembly is a potent mechanism responsible for the host protection against pathogens, including viruses. When compromised, it can allow viral replication, while when disrupted, it can perpetuate pathological responses by IL-1 signaling and pyroptotic cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to activate inflammasome in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, however, potential mechanisms responsible for this response are not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of ORF3a, E and M SARS-CoV-2 viroporins in the inflammasome activation in major populations of alveolar sentinel cells: macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells. We demonstrated that each viroporin is capable of activation of the inflammasome in macrophages to trigger pyroptosis-like cell death and IL-1\u03b1release from epithelial and endothelial cells. Small molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors reduced IL-1 release but weakly affected the pyroptosis. Importantly, we discovered that while SARS-CoV-2 could not infect the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells it induced IL-1\u03b1and IL-33 release. Together, these findings highlight the essential role of macrophages as the major inflammasome-activating cell population in the lungs and point to endothelial cell expressed IL-1\u03b1as a potential novel component driving the pulmonary immunothromobosis in COVID-19."

We propose a Bayesian mixture model to estimate individual infection probabilities, based on 81,797 continuous anti-spike IgG tests from Euroimmun collected in France after the first wave. This approach used serological results as a continuous variable, and was therefore not based on diagnostic cut-offs. Cumulative incidence, which is necessary to compute infection probabilities, was estimated according to age and administrative region. In France, we found that a \u201cnegative\u201d or a \u201cpositive\u201d test, as classified by the manufacturer, could correspond to a probability of infection as high as 61.8% or as low as 67.7%, respectively. \u201cIndeterminate\u201d tests encompassed probabilities of infection ranging from 10.8 to 96.6%.

            "An improved understanding of the underlying physicochemical properties of respiratory aerosol that influence viral infectivity may open new avenues to mitigate the transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that an increase in the pH of respiratory aerosols following generation due to changes in the gas-particle partitioning of pH buffering bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide is a significant factor in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We show here that a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 aerostability results from a moderate increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (e.g. 800 ppm), an effect that is more marked than that observed for changes in relative humidity. We model the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission on the ambient concentration of CO2, concluding that even this moderate increase in CO2concentration results in a significant increase in overall risk. These observations confirm the critical importance of ventilation and maintaining low CO2concentrations in indoor environments for mitigating disease transmission. Moreover, the correlation of increased CO2concentration with viral aerostability need to be better understood when considering the consequences of increases in ambient CO2levels in our atmosphere."

            "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a primary cell surface viral binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, so finding new regulatory molecules to modulate ACE2 expression levels is a promising strategy against COVID-19. In the current study, we utilized islet organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), animal models and COVID-19 patients to discover that fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) enhances ACE2 expression within the islets, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulting in impaired insulin secretion. Using hESC-derived islet organoids, we demonstrated that FGF7 interacts with FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) and FGFR1 to upregulate ACE2 expression predominantly in \u03b2 cells. This upregulation increases both insulin secretion and susceptibility of \u03b2 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhibiting FGFR counteracts the FGF7-induced ACE2 upregulation, subsequently reducing viral infection and replication in the islets. Furthermore, retrospective clinical data revealed that diabetic patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms exhibited elevated serum FGF7 levels compared to those with mild symptoms. Finally, animal experiments indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection increased pancreatic FGF7 levels, resulting in a reduction of insulin concentrations in situ. Taken together, our research offers a potential regulatory strategy for ACE2 by controlling FGF7, thereby protecting islets from SARS-CoV-2 infection and preventing the progression of diabetes in the context of COVID-19."

            "Nitrosative stress promotes protein glycoxidation, and both processes can occur during an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess selected nitrosative stress parameters and protein glycoxidation products in COVID-19 patients and convalescents relative to healthy subjects, including in reference to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. The diagnostic utility of nitrosative stress and protein glycoxidation biomarkers was also evaluated in COVID-19 patients. The study involved 218 patients with COVID-19, 69 convalescents, and 48 healthy subjects. Nitrosative stress parameters (NO, S-nitrosothiols, nitrotyrosine) and protein glycoxidation products (tryptophan, kynurenine, N-formylkynurenine, dityrosine, AGEs) were measured in the blood plasma or serum with the use of colorimetric\/fluorometric methods. The levels of NO (p=\u20090.0480), S-nitrosothiols (p=\u20090.0004), nitrotyrosine (p=\u20090.0175), kynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), N-formylkynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), dityrosine (p<\u20090.0001), and AGEs (p<\u20090.0001) were significantly higher, whereas tryptophan fluorescence was significantly (p<\u20090.0001) lower in COVID-19 patients than in the control group. Significant differences in the analyzed parameters were observed in different stages of COVID-19. In turn, the concentrations of kynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), N-formylkynurenine (p<\u20090.0001), dityrosine (p<\u20090.0001), and AGEs (p<\u20090.0001) were significantly higher, whereas tryptophan levels were significantly (p<\u20090.0001) lower in convalescents than in healthy controls. The ROC analysis revealed that protein glycoxidation products can be useful for diagnosing infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus because they differentiate COVID-19 patients (KN: sensitivity\u201491.20%, specificity\u201492.00%; NFK: sensitivity\u201492.37%, specificity\u201492.00%; AGEs: sensitivity\u201499,02%, specificity\u2014100%) and convalescents (KN: sensitivity\u201482.22%, specificity\u201484.00%; NFK: sensitivity\u201482,86%, specificity\u201486,00%; DT: sensitivity\u2014100%, specificity\u2014100%; AGE: sensitivity\u2014100%, specificity\u2014100%) from healthy subjects with high sensitivity and specificity. Nitrosative stress and protein glycoxidation are intensified both during and after an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The levels of redox biomarkers fluctuate in different stages of the disease. Circulating biomarkers of nitrosative stress\/protein glycoxidation have potential diagnostic utility in both COVID-19 patients and convalescents."

In this study, we investigate the capacity of PAV-104 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway epithelial cells (AECs). We show that PAV-104 inhibits >99% of infection with diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants in immortalized AECs, and in primary human AECs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to represent the lung microenvironment in vivo. Our data demonstrate that PAV-104 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 production without affecting viral entry, mRNA transcription, or protein synthesis. PAV-104 interacts with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and interferes with its oligomerization, blocking particle assembly. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that PAV-104 reverses SARS-CoV-2 induction of the type-I interferon response and the maturation of nucleoprotein signaling pathway known to support coronavirus replication.

Anti-S IgG concentrations, ADCP scores and ACE2 inhibiting antibody concentrations were highest at one-month post-second dose and declined by four-months post-second dose for all groups. mRNA\/mRNA and ChAdOx1-S\/mRNA schedules had significantly higher antibody responses than ChAdOx1-S\/ChAdOx1-S. CD8+T-cell responses one-month post-second dose were associated with increased ACE2 surrogate neutralization. Antibody avidity (total relative avidity index) did not change between one-month and four-months post-second dose and did not significantly differ between groups by four-months post-second dose. In determining COVID-19 correlates of protection, a measure that considers both antibody concentration and avidity should be considered."

It has a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome and encodes two non-structural proteins through viral cysteine-proteases processing. Blocking this step is crucial to control virus replication. In this work, we reported the synthesis of 23 statine-based peptidomimetics to determine their ability to inhibit the main protease (Mpro) activity of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 23 peptidomimetics, 15 compounds effectively inhibited Mpro activity by 50% or more, while three compounds (7d,8e, and9g) exhibited maximum inhibition above 70% and IC50<\u20091\u00a0\u00b5M. Compounds7d,8e,and9ginhibited roughly 80% of SARS-CoV-2 replication and proved no cytotoxicity. Molecular docking simulations show putative hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions between specific amino acids and these inhibitors. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the stability and persisting interactions in Mpro's subsites, exhibiting favorable free energy binding (\u0394Gbind) values. These findings suggest the statine-based peptidomimetics as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 by targeting Mpro."

            "SARS-CoV-2 lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines continue to be administered as the predominant prophylactic measure to reduce COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. Quantifying the kinetics of the secondary immune response from subsequent doses beyond the primary series and understanding how dose-dependent immune waning kinetics vary as a function of age, sex, and various comorbidities remains an important question. We study anti-spike IgG waning kinetics in 152 individuals who received an mRNA-based primary series (first two doses) and a subset of 137 individuals who then received an mRNA-based booster dose. We find the booster dose elicits a 71\u201384% increase in the median Anti-S half life over that of the primary series. We find the Anti-S half life for both primary series and booster doses decreases with age. However, we stress that although chronological age continues to be a good proxy for vaccine-induced humoral waning, immunosenescence is likely not the mechanism, rather, more likely the mechanism is related to the presence of noncommunicable diseases, which also accumulate with age, that affect immune regulation. We are able to independently reproduce recent observations that those with pre-existing asthma exhibit a stronger primary series humoral response to vaccination than compared to those that do not, and further, we find this result is sustained for the booster dose. Finally, via a single-variate Kruskal-Wallis test we find no difference between male and female\u00a0humoral decay kinetics, however, a multivariate approach utilizing \u00a0Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression for feature selection reveals a statistically significant (p\\(<1\\times 10^{-3}\\)), albeit small, bias in favour of longer-lasting humoral immunity amongst males."

GEMCOVAC-OM was well tolerated with no related serious adverse events in both phase 2 and phase 3. In phase 2, the safety and immunogenicity of GEMCOVAC-OM was compared with our prototype mRNA vaccine GEMCOVAC-19 (D614G variant-specific) in 140 participants. At day 29 after vaccination, there was a significant rise in anti-spike (BA.1) IgG antibodies with GEMCOVAC-OM (P<\u20090.0001) and GEMCOVAC-19 (P<\u20090.0001). However, the IgG titers (primary endpoint) and seroconversion were higher with GEMCOVAC-OM (P<\u20090.0001). In phase 3, GEMCOVAC-OM was compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 3,140 participants (safety cohort), which included an immunogenicity cohort of 420 participants. At day 29, neutralizing antibody titers against the BA.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher than baseline in the GEMCOVAC-OM arm (P<\u20090.0001), but not in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 arm (P=\u20090.1490). GEMCOVAC-OM was noninferior (primary endpoint) and superior to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in terms of neutralizing antibody titers and seroconversion rate (lower bound 95% confidence interval of least square geometric mean ratio >1 and difference in seroconversion >0% for superiority). At day 29, anti-spike IgG antibodies and seroconversion (secondary endpoints) were significantly higher with GEMCOVAC-OM (P<\u20090.0001).

            "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has significantly impacted global health, stressing the necessity of basic understanding of the host response to this viral infection. In this study, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 remodels the landscape of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) from a large collection of nasopharyngeal swab samples taken at various time points from patients with distinct symptom severity. High-throughput RNA sequencing analysis revealed a global alteration of the sncRNA landscape, with abundance peaks related to species of 21-23 and 32-33 nucleotides. Host-derived sncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA-derived small RNAs (sdRNAs) exhibited significant differential expression in infected patients compared to controls. Importantly, miRNA expression was predominantly down-regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in patients with severe symptoms. Furthermore, we identified specific tsRNAs derived from Glu- and Gly-tRNAs as major altered elements upon infection, with 5\u2019 tRNA halves being the most abundant species and suggesting their potential as biomarkers for viral presence and disease severity prediction. Additionally, down-regulation of C\/D-box sdRNAs and altered expression of tinyRNAs (tyRNAs) were observed in infected patients. These findings provide valuable insights into the host sncRNA response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may contribute to the development of further diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the clinic."

Indeed, ORF8 is truncated more frequently and knockouts circulate for longer than for any other gene. Using a global phylogeny, we find evidence of positive selection to explain this phenomenon: nonsense mutations resulting in shortened protein products occur more frequently and are associated with faster clade growth rates than synonymous mutations in ORF8.

Professor Johnson's research emphasizes the importance of integrating climate resilience into urban planning and coastal management policies, with a focus on preserving biodiversity and safeguarding local communities against future sea-level rise.'].\n\n**Complex Instruction 2 - Solution:**  \n\nProfessor Johnson's research urges policymakers to adopt green infrastructure in urban planning for coastal resilience.\n\n\n-----------\n\n**Follow up Question 1 (to Complex Instruction 2):**  \n\nHow could Professor Johnson's findings influence the funding allocations within environmental agencies?\n\n\n**Solution:**  \n\nProfessor Johnson's research, with its implications for coastal resilience through green infrastructure solutions, is likely to advocate for increased financial support towards sustainable development projects. Environmental agencies may respond by reallocating budgets to prioritize climate adaptation initiatives such as the construction of sea walls using eco-friendly materials, restoration of mangroves and wetlands that act as natural barriers against erosion and habitat loss, and investments in renewable energy sources. This strategic shift would align with a proactive approach to mitigate coastal impacts while supporting biodiversity.\n\n\n**Follow up Question 2 (to Complex Instruction 2):**  \n\nHow can policymakers use the data from Professor Johnson's study when creating legislation related to climate change?\n\n\n**Solution:**  \n\nPolicymakers can leverage Professor Johnson's comprehensive data by incorporating scientific evidence into legislative frameworks that mandate resilience-building measures. The research findings could inform laws requiring the integration of green infrastructure in coastal city planning, zoning regulations for new developments to consider sea-level rise projections, and guidelines for preserving biodiversity within urban ecosystems. Legislators can also establish funding mechanisms or grants dedicated to these climate adaptation projects, ensuring that the research's call for action translates into tangible policy initiatives aimed at minimizing future risks associated with rising sea levels.\n\n\n**Follow up Question 3 (to Complex Instruction 2):**  \n\nWhat are some potential challenges in implementing green infrastructure based on Professor Johnson's research recommendations, and how might these be addressed?\n\n\n**Solution:**  \n\nImplementing green infrastructure may encounter challenges such as financial constraints, public resistance to change, lack of technical expertise, and bureaucratic hurdles. To address these issues, a multifaceted approach is needed:\n\n\n- Financial Challenges: Policymakers can incentivize green infrastructure through tax credits, subsidies, or grants to reduce initial costs for developers and municipalities. Public-private partnerships could also be fostered to share financial burdens while benefiting from the expertise of private entities.\n\n\n- Public Resistance: Educational campaigns explaining the long-term benefits of green infrastructure can help in gaining public support. Including community voices in planning processes may increase acceptance and participation.\n\n\n- Lack of Expertise: Training programs for professionals in sustainable design, coupled with technical assistance from research institutions like Professor Johnson's, could build the necessary workforce skilled in implementing green infrastructure projects effectively.\n\n\n- Bureaucratic Hurdles: Streamlining permitting processes and creating clear guidelines can help overcome administrative barriers to implementation. Engaging stakeholders early on ensures that project planning is thorough and meets all regulatory requirements while minimizing delays.\n\n\nBy proactively addressing these challenges, policymakers can create an enabling environment for the adoption of green infrastructure solutions, thus advancing climate change resilience in line with Professor Johnson's recommendations.",

            "Evidence suggests associations between COVID-19 patients or vaccines and glycometabolic dysfunction and an even higher risk of the occurrence of diabetes. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed pancreatic lesions in autopsy tissues from 67 SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates (NHPs) models and 121 vaccinated and infected NHPs from 2020 to 2023 and COVID-19 patients. Multi-label immunofluorescence revealed direct infection of both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells by the virus in NHPs and humans. Minor and limited phenotypic and histopathological changes were observed in adult models. Systemic proteomics and metabolomics results indicated metabolic disorders, mainly enriched in insulin resistance pathways, in infected adult NHPs, along with elevated fasting C-peptide and C-peptide\/glucose ratio levels. Furthermore, in elder COVID-19 NHPs, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes loss of beta (\u03b2) cells and lower expressed-insulin in situ characterized by islet amyloidosis and necrosis, activation of \u03b1-SMA and aggravated fibrosis consisting of lower collagen in serum, an increase of pancreatic inflammation and stress markers, ICAM-1 and G3BP1, along with more severe glycometabolic dysfunction. In contrast, vaccination maintained glucose homeostasis by activating insulin receptor \u03b1 and insulin receptor \u03b2. Overall, the cumulative risk of diabetes post-COVID-19 is closely tied to age, suggesting more attention should be paid to blood sugar management in elderly COVID-19 patients."

            "Several studies have suggested the imprinting of SARS-CoV-2 immunity by original immune challenge without addressing the formation of the de novo response to successive antigen exposures. As this is crucial for the development of the original antigenic sin, we assessed the immune response against the mutated epitopes of omicron SARS-CoV-2 after vaccine breakthrough. Our data demonstrate a robust humoral response in thrice-vaccinated individuals following omicron breakthrough which is a recall of vaccine-induced memory. The humoral and memory B cell responses against the altered regions of the omicron surface proteins are impaired. The T cell responses to mutated epitopes of the omicron spike protein are present due to the high cross-reactivity of vaccine-induced T cells rather than the formation of a de novo response. Our findings, therefore, underpin the speculation that the imprinting of SARS-CoV-2 immunity by vaccination may lead to the development of original antigenic sin if future variants overcome the vaccine-induced immunity."

In this observational study, individuals with prior infection (n=\u200964) showed higher vaccine-induced anti-spike IgG-antibodies and neutralizing titers, but the relative increase was significantly higher in non-infected individuals (n=\u200963). In general, both groups showed higher neutralizing activity towards the parental strain than towards Omicron-subvariants BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5. In contrast, CD4 or CD8 T cell levels towards spike from the parental strain and the Omicron-subvariants, and cytokine expression profiles were similar irrespective of prior infection. Breakthrough infections occurred more frequently among previously non-infected individuals, who had significantly lower vaccine-induced spike-specific neutralizing activity and CD4 T cell levels. In summary, we show that immunogenicity after BA.4\/5-bivalent vaccination differs between individuals with and without prior infection. Moreover, our results may help to improve prediction of breakthrough infections."

            "Accessible SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoassays may inform clinical management in people with HIV, particularly in case of persisting immunodysfunction. We prospectively studied their application in vaccine recipients with HIV, purposely including participants with a history of advanced HIV infection. Participants received one (n\u2009=\u2009250), two (n\u2009=\u2009249) or three (n\u2009=\u200942) doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Adverse events were documented through questionnaires. Sample collection occurred pre-vaccination and a median of 4 weeks post-second dose and 14 weeks post-third dose. Anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were measured with the Roche Elecsys chemiluminescence immunoassays. Neutralising activity was evaluated using the GenScript cPass surrogate virus neutralisation test, following validation against a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test. T-cell reactivity was assessed with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 IFN\u03b3 release assay. Primary vaccination (2 doses) was well tolerated and elicited measurable anti-spike antibodies in 202\/206 (98.0%) participants. Anti-spike titres varied widely, influenced by previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, ethnicity, intravenous drug use, CD4 counts and HIV viremia as independent predictors. A third vaccine dose significantly boosted anti-spike and neutralising responses, reducing variability. Anti-spike titres\u2009>\u200915 U\/mL correlated with neutralising activity in 136\/144 paired samples (94.4%). Three participants with detectable anti-S antibodies did not develop cPass\u00a0neutralising responses post-third dose, yet displayed SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN\u03b3 responses. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults with HIV, with responses improving post-third dose. Anti-spike antibodies serve as a reliable indicator of neutralising activity. Discordances between anti-spike and neutralising responses were accompanied by detectable IFN-\u03b3 responses, underlining the complexity of the immune response in this population."

        "abstract":[
            "Drug resistance poses a significant challenge in the development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we identified two double mutations, M49K\/M165V and M49K\/S301P, in the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) that confer resistance to a novel non-covalent inhibitor, WU-04, which is currently in phase III clinical trials (NCT06197217). Crystallographic analysis indicates that the M49K mutation destabilizes the WU-04-binding pocket, impacting the binding of WU-04 more significantly than the binding of 3CLpro substrates. The M165V mutation directly interferes with WU-04 binding. The S301P mutation, which is far from the WU-04-binding pocket, indirectly affects WU-04 binding by restricting the rotation of 3CLpro\u2019s C-terminal tail and impeding 3CLpro dimerization. We further explored 3CLpro mutations that confer resistance to two clinically used inhibitors: ensitrelvir and nirmatrelvir, and revealed a trade-off between the catalytic activity, thermostability, and drug resistance of 3CLpro. We found that mutations at the same residue (M49) can have distinct effects on the 3CLpro inhibitors, highlighting the importance of developing multiple antiviral agents with different skeletons for fighting SARS-CoV-2. These findings enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 resistance mechanisms and inform the development of effective therapeutics."

            "To figure out how does SARS-CoV-2 affect sperm parameters and what influencing factors affect the recovery of sperm quality after infection? We conducted a prospective cohort study and initially included 122 men with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The longest time to track semen quality after infection is 112\u00a0days and 58 eligible patients were included in our study eventually. We subsequently exploited a linear mixed-effects model to statistically analyze their semen parameters at different time points before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Semen parameters were significantly reduced after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including total sperm count (211 [147; 347] to 167 [65.0; 258],P<\u20090.001), sperm concentration (69.0 [38.8; 97.0] to 51.0 [25.5; 71.5],P<\u20090.001), total sperm motility (57.5 [52.3; 65.0] to 51.0 [38.5; 56.8],P<\u20090.001), progressive motility (50.0 [46.2; 58.0] to 45.0 [31.5; 52.8],P<\u20090.001). The parameters displayed the greatest diminution within 30\u00a0days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, gradually recovered thereafter, and exhibited no significant difference after 90\u00a0days compared with prior to COVID-19 infection. In addition, the patients in the group with a low-grade fever showed a declining tendency in semen parameters, but not to a significant degree, whereas those men with a moderate or high fever produced a significant drop in the same parameters. Semen parameters were significantly reduced after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fever severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection may constitute the main influencing factor in reducing semen parameters in patients after recovery, but the effect is reversible and the semen parameters gradually return to normal with the realization of a new spermatogenic cycle."
