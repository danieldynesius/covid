Using recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 and nasal epithelial cells cultured at the liquid-air interface, we show that mutations unique to Omicron Spike enable enhanced entry into nasal tissue. Unlike earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, our findings suggest that Omicron enters nasal cells independently of serine transmembrane proteases and instead relies upon metalloproteinases to catalyze membrane fusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this entry pathway unlocked by Omicron Spike enables evasion from constitutive and interferon-induced antiviral factors that restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry following attachment. Therefore, the increased transmissibility exhibited by Omicron in humans may be attributed not only to its evasion of vaccine-elicited adaptive immunity, but also to its superior invasion of nasal epithelia and resistance to the cell-intrinsic barriers present therein.","article_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-024-45075-8","layman_title":"The Omicron variant of COVID-19 increases the virus's ability to infect human nasal tissue while also making it resistant to interferons, which are proteins that help fight off viruses.","layman_abstract":"This research shows that the Omicron variant exhibits increased infectivity in primary adult upper airway tissue compared to Delta, due to unique mutations in its spike protein allowing for enhanced entry into nasal cells and evasion from antiviral factors.","needs_ai_processing":0},{"index":2,"article_title":"Identification of a highly conserved neutralizing epitope within the RBD region of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants","publication_date":"2024-01-29","abstract":"The constant emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants continues to impair the efficacy of existing neutralizing antibodies, especially XBB.1.5 and EG.5, which showed exceptional immune evasion properties.

The current work was aimed at developing a simple platform to do so. Biologically active and antigenic Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD, as well as mutated RBD variants found in nature, were successfully displayed on filamentous phages. Mutational scanning confirmed the global plasticity of the receptor binding motif within RBD, highlighted residues playing a critical role in receptor binding, and identified mutations strengthening the interaction. The ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to inhibit ACE2 binding of many mutated RBD variants, albeit at different extents, was shown. Amino acid replacements which could compromise such inhibitory potential were underscored.

Mice immunized with LNP-mRNA-RBD based on the ancestral strain (ancestral-type LNP-mRNA-RBD) showed similar cellular responses against the ancestral strain and BA.5, but their neutralizing activity against BA.5 was lower than that against the ancestral strain. The ancestral-type LNP-mRNA-RBD protected mice from the ancestral strain or BA.5 challenge; however, its ability to reduce the viral burdens after BA.5 challenge was limited. In contrast, immunization with bivalent LNP-mRNA-RBD consisting of the ancestral-type and BA.4\/5-type LNP-mRNA-RBD or monovalent BA.4\/5-type LNP-mRNA-RBD elicited robust cellular responses, as well as high and moderate neutralizing titers against BA.5 and XBB.1.5, respectively. Furthermore, the vaccines containing BA.4\/5-type LNP-mRNA-RBD remarkably reduced the viral burdens following BA.5 or XBB.1.5 challenge. Overall, our findings suggest that LNP-mRNA-RBD is effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","article_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41541-023-00800-0","layman_title":"An mRNA Vaccine Against COVID-19 Protects Mice From Different Omicron Variants","layman_abstract":"This research assessed a lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccine candidate encoding the receptor-binding domain (LNP-mRNA-RBD) in mice, showing effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection but limited protection against BA.5 variant; a bivalent LNP-mRNA-RBD containing both ancestral and BA.4\/5 types elicited better immune responses and reduced viral burdens against multiple variants.","needs_ai_processing":0},{"index":52,"article_title":"Integrated multi-omics analyses identify anti-viral host factors and pathways controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection","publication_date":"2024-01-02","abstract":"Host anti-viral factors are essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection but remain largely unknown due to the biases of previous large-scale studies toward pro-viral host factors. To fill in this knowledge gap, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR dropout screen and integrate analyses of the multi-omics data of the CRISPR screen, genome-wide association studies, single-cell RNA-Seq, and host-virus proteins or protein\/RNA interactome. This study uncovers many host factors that are currently underappreciated, including the components of V-ATPases, ESCRT, and N-glycosylation pathways that modulate viral entry and\/or replication. The cohesin complex is also identified as an anti-viral pathway, suggesting an important role of three-dimensional chromatin organization in mediating host-viral interaction. Furthermore, we discover another anti-viral regulator KLF5, a transcriptional factor involved in sphingolipid metabolism, which is up-regulated, and harbors genetic variations linked to COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. Anti-viral effects of three identified candidates (DAZAP2\/VTA1\/KLF5) are confirmed individually. Molecular characterization of DAZAP2\/VTA1\/KLF5-knockout cells highlights the involvement of genes related to the coagulation system in determining the severity of COVID-19. Together, our results provide further resources for understanding the host anti-viral network during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may help develop new countermeasure strategies.","article_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-023-44175-1","layman_title":"Multi-omics Analysis Reveals Host Factors and Pathways Affecting SARS-CoV-2 Infection","layman_abstract":"This study identifies underappreciated host factors that modulate viral entry and replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including components of V-ATPases, ESCRT, and N-glycosylation pathways, the cohesin complex, and the transcriptional factor KLF5, which is linked to severe COVID-19 symptoms.","needs_ai_processing":0},{"index":53,"article_title":"Cytokine signature in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving vedolizumab","publication_date":"2024-01-02","abstract":"While differential antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving infliximab and vedolizumab are well-characterized, the immune pathways underlying these differences remain unknown. Prior to COVID-19 vaccine development, we screened 235 patients with IBD receiving biological therapy for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and measured serum cytokines. In seropositive patients, we prospectively collected clinical data. We found a cytokine signature in patients receiving vedolizumab who are seropositive compared with seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may be linked to repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, there were no differences between seropositive and seronegative patients receiving infliximab. In this single-center cohort of patients with IBD with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore without influence of vaccination, there is a cytokine signature in patients receiving vedolizumab but not infliximab. These findings lay the groundwork for further studies on immune consequences of viral infection in patients with IBD, which is postulated to evolve from aberrant host-microbe responses.","article_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-023-50035-1","layman_title":"Cytokine Patterns in Recovered COVID-19 Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Taking Vedolizumab","layman_abstract":"The research study aimed at understanding the differences in differential antibody responses of SARS-CoV-2 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients receiving biological therapies, infliximab and vedolizumab, to understand the underlying immune pathways.
